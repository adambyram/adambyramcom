	<h2 class="title">First Time Skiing</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>Since I moved to Tennessee, I&rsquo;ve wanted to go try out skiing &ndash; mainly because
it&rsquo;s relatively close to where I live, so it alwayed seemed like a good thing
to try while I&rsquo;m in the area.  Well, yesterday, I tried skiing for the first
time&hellip;</p>

<p>I went to <a href="http://www.obergatlinburg.com/">Ober Gatlinburg</a> with a couple of
co-workers.  I haven&rsquo;t heard great things about Ober, but it took less than an
hour to get there and we all had free passes for the ski lift because of a
Hardee&rsquo;s promotion earlier in the week.  My friends let me borrow the basic
items that I&rsquo;d need (other than the skis themselves) so the whole trip really
only cost $13 for skis&hellip;although I did buy a pair of goggles while I was
there, but I could have done without them.</p>

<p>The overall ski experience was interesting.  I&rsquo;ve never waterskied, so this
was my first time on skis period.  After falling down the &ldquo;ski school&rdquo; slope a
couple of times, my friends decided it was time we all take the ski lift up to
a long, but easy run.  I didn&rsquo;t think I was ready for that, but eventually I
went anyway.  Those ski lifts are harder to exit than I would have thought &ndash;
in fact, I never was able to successfully exit the thing without falling (I
could slide away, but never got very far).</p>

<p>As far as skiing down the mountain, well, when the snow was fresh (it was
snowing a lot while we were there), I could control my speed pretty well in
general.  I still fell a lot, but it was usually because I hit a steeper area
and I&rsquo;d lose my balance when I sped up too much.  I never really figured out
how to turn with the skis, I did figure out how to wobble a bit so I could
shift my weight slightly to turn just a little, but never got the hang of
doing a regular turn.</p>

<p>As the night went on, I think the slopes got more icy.  It certainly got
pretty chilly, but by the last run I made, I could barely control the ski
speed even though I was doing the same thing I did before.  So my last run was
relatively fast, but a bit more painful since I kept falling faster and pretty
repeatedly.</p>

<p>Today, I&rsquo;m totally sore.  I kept falling in the same position, so I banged up
one side pretty good (but I was never going very fast so no lasting injuries
or anything)&hellip;some good bruises though.  I wish I got the hang of skiing and
I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s just like a friend was telling me &ndash; I just had to let go when I
started going faster and just go with it.  The problem is that I&rsquo;m not a big
adrenaline junkie &ndash; so I don&rsquo;t want to go fast or feel that out of control, so
I never could quite let go and I&rsquo;m pretty positive that is what made me fall
so much once I started going at a good pace (because I know I kept leaning
back too far and my skis came out from under me).  Overall, I&rsquo;m glad I went
since I&rsquo;ve wanted to try skiing, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be going back.  Skiing
just isn&rsquo;t for me, but it was certainly an interesting experience.</p>
