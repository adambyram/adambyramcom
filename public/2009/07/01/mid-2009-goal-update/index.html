	<h2 class="title">Mid-2009 Goal Update</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>So I thought it would be good to post an update on the ol&#8217; blog here and since
it&rsquo;s the middle of the year, it seems fitting that the post should be an
update on my 2009 goals&hellip;.so here goes&hellip;</p>

<h4>Financial</h4>

<ul>
<li>Fully fund 2008 &amp; 2009 Roth IRAs <strong>[2008 fully funded; 2009 money saved, but not in Roth account yet] </strong></li>
<li>Pay off second mortgage OR refinance into single mortgage (with much lower rate and no PMI) <strong>[I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this and I&rsquo;m not sure I want to go ahead with this right now. The total cost to ReFi was higher than I expected for the great rates and the reality is that my second mortgage isn&rsquo;t hurting that much.  Given certain things going on in my career right now, holding on to the money seems like a wise thing to do for the moment. At present, about &frac12; of this is already in savings.] </strong></li>
<li>Get my side income up to the point I could live off of it if the need arose (NOT trying to get this to replace my actual income level…although that would be fantastic if it did) <strong>[This is about the same or lower than it was at the start of the year &ndash; I&rsquo;m still trying to hit this goal though.] </strong></li>
<li>Maintain at least a 3 month emergency fund (currently at 12 months, but expect some of this to use used for other financial goals) <strong>[I&rsquo;ve got around 6-8 months still hanging around at the moment, so even if I reallocate some of this for the mortgage payoff or towards investments, I&rsquo;ll still be able to reach this goal just fine.]</strong></li>
</ul>


<h4>Health</h4>

<ul>
<li>Get weight to 190 or lower and keep it there (~25 lbs to lose) <strong>[Yeah&hellip;still um, working on this one.  Good news is I didn&rsquo;t gain much weight&hellip;but I also didn&rsquo;t exactly lose any either.  This one is still doable though&hellip;]</strong></li>
<li>Decrease caffeine intake &ndash; and keep it down (target is around 1 12oz can of soda per day or less) <strong>[I did this one for a couple of months and now I&rsquo;m back to drinking more soda than I should be.  I&rsquo;ve done a decent job of keeping it out of the fridge at home, but at work, that&rsquo;s a different story.  Going to refocus on this one.]</strong></li>
<li>Drink more water (no particular amount &ndash; just when I’m thirsty, grab a water instead of a soda) <strong>[I&rsquo;ve been drinking a moderate amount of water, but I&rsquo;m still prone to grab a soda&hellip;so I need to focus more on this one as well.  It&rsquo;s perfectly doable, but still on the ToDo list.]</strong></li>
<li>Cook (healthly-ish) meals at home more than I eat out (including lunch) <strong>[Um, yeah&hellip;.gotta get the ball rolling on this one too.  The biggest problem here is going to lunch with the guys at work.  I have to stop that &ndash; it&rsquo;ll help save a bit of money and be a bit healthier.]</strong></li>
</ul>


<h4>Personal &amp; Professional Development / Other</h4>

<ul>
<li>Read at least 1 non-fiction (but not computer related) book a month <strong>[I&rsquo;m going to miss this goal &ndash; with everything else going on, I just can&rsquo;t do this.  I do have a couple of new books to read &ndash; but not 12.]</strong></li>
<li>Read at least 1 fiction book a month <strong>[Same as the non-fiction goal&hellip;I&rsquo;d like to read a couple, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll get more than that in this year.] </strong></li>
<li>Attend WWDC 2009 (contingent on other financial goals being met/on track in May) <strong>[This one is completed.  I went to WWDC a few weeks ago&hellip;that reminds me, I need to blog about that&hellip;]</strong></li>
<li>Get my passport <strong>[Still need to do this one&hellip;I&rsquo;m not in a rush for it though, I&rsquo;d just like to get it done so I have it for the future.] </strong></li>
<li>Write at least one blog post per week on this blog &ndash; just to start writing more <strong>[If you&rsquo;ve checked this blog much you know I haven&rsquo;t been anywhere close to successful on this one.  I need to make time for this, just for my own sake, but I&rsquo;m not sure if I can do that.  I&rsquo;ll probably put a preference to posting on my business blog over this one and still only post on this one when I have something in general that I want to share.]</strong>
So how do I feel about my progress?  Financially, I feel really good.  While
all of the goals aren&rsquo;t completed just yet, I&rsquo;m nearly there number wise&hellip;and
that&rsquo;s after taking into account the WWDC trip and a trip to Las Vegas.
Health wise, I really dropped the ball.  I got distracted with too many other
things and this set of goals really suffered.  I&rsquo;m slightly disappointed with
my progress on the personal/professional goals, but at the same time, I&rsquo;ve had
a heck of a lot happen and learned a lot over the last 6 months. While I may
not have accomplished the specific goals I outlined at the beginning of the
year, I think I&rsquo;ve still grown quite a lot in this area so at least progress
is being made.</li>
</ul>
