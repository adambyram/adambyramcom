    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some of you may know my cat situation.  If you&#8217;re not aware, the long and the short of it is that my cats used to only eat dry cat food.  One of the cats ended up getting very sick when I moved to Los Angeles.  After she recovered (she&#8217;s fine now), she decided she&#8217;ll never eat dry food again and only eats very specific wet cat food.</p>

<p>The problem is that I have two very nice automated dry food feeders that I can&#8217;t use.  Both cats need to be on a schedule to help control their weight.  So I started researching wet cat food feeders and it turns out, there aren&#8217;t many.  Not only that, the feeders that are out there all use ice packs which limit you to 8 or maybe 12 hours of feeding.  That&#8217;s totally not acceptable to me so I&#8217;ve decided I&#8217;m going to try to design my own wet cat food feeder.</p>

<h3>What</h3>

<p>So what is this thing?  Well, it&#8217;s a small (~2 ft wide) unit that has a certain number of rotating food cups.  The food cups can be filled with wet food (or dry food) and the unit can be programmed to expose each food cup to the cats on a specific schedule.  The unexposed food will stay seal up inside the unit and a cooling unit will keep the unexposed food nice and cool.</p>

<p>The goal is to have the unit keep food at refridgerated temperatures (TBD what that means) consistently to allow food to be stored in the unit for up to three days.  That seems to be the maximum time wet food is allowed to be refridgerated based on manufacturer information, so that&#8217;ll be the target for version 1.</p>

<p>If the machine can feed twice a day for an overnight trip or once a day for a long weekend trip, it&#8217;ll be fantastic, so that&#8217;s the target.</p>

<h3>Why</h3>

<p>On top of the issues mentioned above, I really want a exposure to the hardware + software world.  I&#8217;ve worked on software for quite a long time and basically everything I&#8217;ve built is totally virtual in nature.  That&#8217;s all fine and good, but I&#8217;m really wanting build something physical.  Of course, some software will still be needed, but I&#8217;ll also get some electrical engineering, product design, and CAD modeling.</p>

<p>The other part of the why is that I really want to be able to go on a long weekend trip and not have to worry about the cats getting fed.  Today, we basically can&#8217;t be gone for longer than about 8 hours at a time without having someone come by to feed the cats.</p>

<h3>How</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m planning on building everything with some pretty common parts.  The initial design / prototype is going to be all plastic, mainly because I&#8217;m getting a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2105227104/ultra-bot-3d-printer">3D printer</a> in December.  The general electronics won&#8217;t be anything super special.  For the prototype, I&#8217;ll be using an Arduino Uno for overall control, a motor controller board to rotate the food dish, a external power module to power the cooling system, and a few other random bits.</p>

<p>For cooling, I&#8217;m planning on using a Peltier cooler.  They aren&#8217;t very efficient, but they are relatively easy to use and they can work reasonably well (based on my experience with a little mini fridge).  They are also pretty cheap, so it&#8217;s quite cost effective from a component perspective.  The cooling will be the trickiest aspect of the whole project.</p>

<h3>When</h3>

<p>Well, I&#8217;ve already started playing with the basic components and working on the hardware design (the body of the feeder, not the electronic components).  The 3D printer won&#8217;t be available until later in December, so I can&#8217;t start working on the real prototype until then, but I&#8217;ll be able to play with the cooling system this month and into November.  My goal is to have a really rough 3D model ready by the time the printer is available.  I&#8217;m assuming I&#8217;ll needed lots of revisions to the plastic parts since all of this (the design process, printing process, and design software) is new to me, but I want to be able to hit the ground running.</p>

<p>As far as the finished product, I&#8217;m hoping to have a totally working prototype in Q1 2013.  Will that happen? I have no idea, but I really, really want this product so I&#8217;d like to have something working sooner rather than later.</p>

<h3>What&#8217;s Next</h3>

<p>I plan to blog my progress on this project.  It&#8217;s as much for me to keep track of things as it is for everyone else to follow along.  Next time, I&#8217;ll show the current stage of the design and share some thoughts on the design process as well as the design software I&#8217;m using.  This should be a fun project, so I hope you have as much fun following along as I&#8217;m having building this thing.</p>

    <link href="http://www.adambyram.com/2012/01/05/thoughts-on-the-13-macbook-air/"/>
    <updated>2012-01-05T21:53:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adambyram.com/2012/01/05/thoughts-on-the-13-macbook-air</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve had my 13&#8221; MacBook Air (mid-2011 model) for a few weeks now and thought it&#8217;d be a good idea to share my impressions.  I originally moved to Apple on a black MacBook, then switched to a top end 17&#8221; MacBook Pro, and now I&#8217;m on an Air.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s Good?</h2>

<p><strong>Weight</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s fantastically light.  My MacBook Pro feels like a brick after using the MBA for a while.</p>

<p><strong>Size</strong></p>

<p>Not only is it light, it&#8217;s thin.  Like, really thin.  It&#8217;s not really that much thicker than my iPad and that&#8217;s impressive when you consider it&#8217;s a full featured computer.</p>

<p><strong>Battery Life</strong></p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t used it for photo/video editing nor have I used it for games, so my usage is pretty moderate, but still, the battery life is excellent.  My MacBook Pro has a good battery life for its size, but the Air has been really impressive.  I haven&#8217;t timed the battery life, but I can say that I frequently use it for extended periods of time without even thinking about the power cable.  That hasn&#8217;t been my experience with other laptops (Apple or otherwise).</p>

<p><strong>Solid State Drive</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s amazing how much of a difference a solid state drive makes.  Startup is extremely fast, launching apps is even faster, and even development in a virtual machine is faster.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s Bad?</h2>

<p><strong>Screen Size</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s totally usable for most of my everyday tasks, but for things like development, it&#8217;s a bit small.  The good news is that it powers an external monitor just fine.  If you&#8217;re on the go and need to do certain kinds of tasks, it&#8217;ll feel a bit cramped.  I can&#8217;t imagine the MacBook Airs line won&#8217;t merge with the MacBook Pro line to provide the larger screen sizes in the future.</p>

<h2>Other Thoughts</h2>

<p>That&#8217;s actually the only negative thing I&#8217;ve noticed.  I happen to have the 4GB RAM/256GB SSD model, so it&#8217;s maxed out on the basic specs.  It&#8217;d be nice if the RAM went up to 8GB, but honestly, 4GB has been plenty (even with large-ish databases loaded) due to the SSD.  The storage space may end up being a problem for me down the road if I started storing my main photo library, but I&#8217;m undecided how I want to handle that.  Overall, the MacBook Air is the best laptop I&#8217;ve used for my everyday tasks.  I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find a few things where I miss the power of my PC workstation or my MacBook Pro, but so far, I&#8217;ve really impressed.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s that time of year again.  These goals will change over the course of the year, but today, my goals for 2012 are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pay off cat medical debt</li>
<li>Sell (or rent) house</li>
<li>Launch at least one new iOS game or app</li>
<li>Get involved with open source</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, the standard goals of lose weight, eat better, save more, and the like are all things I plan to work on as well.  The goals above are specific to 2012.  It should be a fun &amp; exciting year.</p>

    <link href="http://www.adambyram.com/2011/12/31/switching-to-octopress/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-31T19:08:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adambyram.com/2011/12/31/switching-to-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been looking into Octopress for a month or so now and I finally decided to take the plunge.  As of now, this blog is now powered by Octopress (more or less out of the box) instead of WordPress.  I&#8217;d like to change the theme a bit, but it&#8217;s good enough that I&#8217;ll leave it for now.</p>

<h3>WordPress -> Octopress</h3>

<p>Nothing was wrong with WordPress itself, but I just didn&#8217;t use any of the features it offered.  I&#8217;d rather just type the blog posts in a regular editor instead of a textbox on a webpage.  There are some great tools out there that help with that of course, but I just don&#8217;t need the features there either.  In addition, maintaining WordPress means logging in pretty often to check for updates, apply them, make sure the database is backed up, etc.  All of that would be just fine if I received enough benefit to offset the time there, but I just didn&#8217;t.</p>

<h3>Enter Heroku</h3>

<p>In addition to switching the blogging engine, I moved the physical blog from Linode over to Heroku + Amazon S3.  My blog is very low traffic, so I don&#8217;t need a high powered VPS host that I have to maintain &amp; patch.  Heroku offers a free account if you don&#8217;t need much power and can live without a database (well, effectively without a DB - a 5MB one is included).  I decided to go ahead and put any post specific images/files onto S3 since Heroku offers a limited amount of local storage and I can also redeploy back to Linode if something doesn&#8217;t work out at Heroku.  For the record though, I <em>love</em> Linode for a Linux VPS host.  I highly recommend them as long as you&#8217;re comfortable dealing with Linux via the command line.</p>

<h3>Simplicity</h3>

<p>As I get older, the technology side of things appeals to me less and less.  I still love technology in general, but the nitty gritty details of what platform/framework/OS/whatever is the best is less and less interesting to me.  I&#8217;m more interested in the best way to deliver a solution in a way that is as simple as possible.  That doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m adverse to complexity under the hood though. It means I value the experience, productivity, and the ability to simply get things done over the technical aspects of a solution.</p>

    <id>http://www.adambyram.com/2011/12/31/looking-back-on-2011</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2011 was a crazy year for me.  It was a year full of change.  This year I:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Started dating my beautiful girlfriend</p></li>
<li><p>Watched the last launch of Space Shuttle Discovery from the NASA press site thanks to the STS-133 NASATweetup</p></li>
<li><p>Took a great vacation to Charleston, SC</p></li>
<li><p>Turned 30</p></li>
<li><p>Moved 2200 miles from the East Coast to the West Coast for a new job</p></li>
<li><p>Began working a dream job in the space industry</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There were some low points in 2011, but overall, it&#8217;s been a good year.  In a lot of ways, I feel like 2011 was a transitional year.  All of the change is mostly finished at this point, so it feels like it&#8217;s time for the good stuff to begin.  I&#8217;m <em>really</em> excited about 2012 - I think like it&#8217;s going to be an amazing year.</p>

    <link href="http://www.adambyram.com/2011/11/26/blog-block/"/>
    <updated>2011-11-26T01:28:06-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adambyram.com/2011/11/26/blog-block</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really thought I&#8217;d have a lot to blog about since this whole week was a
pretty crazy cross country adventure&#8230;but I can&#8217;t seem to focus on blogging
at the moment.  I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s just a writer&#8217;s block thing or what.
Whenever I sit down to write, I keep thinking I&#8217;m writing out some formal
document and that ends up causing me to keep thinking about it and then I just
stop.  My goal is to blog <em>more</em> now that I&#8217;m out in LA and I have lots of
friends around the country that will probably be interested in updates.  At
this point, I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;m going to do.  I thought about just using
Tumblr instead of my own custom WordPress install or I may simply start fresh
with this domain.  I&#8217;ll definitely find a way to send out updates on my LA
adventure, but it looks like it&#8217;ll be a little bit longer.</p>

<p>One quick update though - I did make it to LA just fine and both kitties made
it smoothly.  My furniture isn&#8217;t here yet, so my apartment is basically empty
at the moment, but at least I&#8217;m here.  I&#8217;ll post more in the near future, but
so far, so good.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is my last day of work on the East Coast. It&#8217;s a sad day since I&#8217;m
leaving a stable company full of good people and interesting opportunities. At
the same time, it&#8217;s an exciting day since I&#8217;m leaving so I can prepare myself
for the 2200 mile move to Los Angeles before I start my dream job of building
spaceships. I never thought I&#8217;d be trading my reasonably large house in
Tennessee and basically all of my stuff for a tiny one bedroom apartment in
LA, but I never thought I&#8217;d be able to work on spaceships either.</p>

<p>I got a great send off from my coworkers. A few of them decided to do a little
decorating to my cube&#8230;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few guys I know decided to start a photo group on Flickr called Alter
Oculos. It&#8217;s a group for sharing photowalk images and trying out some photo
projects as a group. This week, we decided to all use the same set of shots,
but then we&#8217;ll all process them and compare our take on the post processing.
These are my two finished images. I think the first turned out ok, but I
really like the second image quite a lot.</p>

    <link href="http://www.adambyram.com/2011/01/03/goals-2011-edition/"/>
    <updated>2011-01-03T20:07:08-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adambyram.com/2011/01/03/goals-2011-edition</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year, I&#8217;m setting 5 major goals for myself. I have several other
behaviors to change/actions to take this year, but I&#8217;m only considering these
five items my goals since they are realistic, actionable, and measurable.</p>

<h3>Release a new app or website</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working on several ideas over the last year or so and I&#8217;m going to
really push to get at least one new project released publicly. I&#8217;m not going
to be more specific other than the new &#8220;thing&#8221; will must be something anyone
can sign up for or download. Open source, closed source, free, or paid -
doesn&#8217;t matter - I just want to complete v1.0 of a new project.</p>

<h3>Max out 401K &amp; Roth IRA</h3>

<p>Pretty simple - $16,500 pre-tax dollars into the 401K and $5,000 of after-tax
dollars into a Roth IRA.</p>

<h3>Lose weight</h3>

<p>Nothing special about this goal. I&#8217;m targeting 35 pounds lost by the end of
the year. I&#8217;ve had this one on my goal list for a while, so it&#8217;s time to
finally knock this one off.</p>

<h3>Write a journal entry a day</h3>

<p>This is a new one for me. I wanted to do a 365 photo project, but I&#8217;d really
like to do more writing&#8230;so a 365 writing project it is. I won&#8217;t be
publishing these, but I&#8217;m really enjoying it so far (even though I&#8217;m only 3
days in).</p>

<p>2011 feels different from years past, so I have pretty high hopes for
accomplishing these goals (as well as several other things).</p>

    <link href="http://www.adambyram.com/2010/12/28/looking-back-on-2010/"/>
    <updated>2010-12-28T23:57:51-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adambyram.com/2010/12/28/looking-back-on-2010</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in January, I posted my [top three goals for
2010.](http://www.adambyram.com/2010/01/10/my-goals-the-2010-edition/</p>

<p>)</p>

<p>So how did I do? Well&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Goal: Get Healthy</strong><br/>
Result: Failed - I totally bombed this one. A lot of changes happened in 2010
that distracted me from this goal. This WILL be happening in 2011.</p>

<p><strong>Goal: Side Income to Livable Levels</strong><br/>
Result: Success / Not Applicable - This originally came about because I wanted
to leave me previous job and work for myself. I did end up working for myself
anyway, but I didn&#8217;t get my side income to livable levels. Having said that, I
did start a new job which negated this goal (and resulted in an even better
outcome in a lot of ways). I still love the idea of running my own business
and maybe it&#8217;ll happen when it&#8217;s time. I tried to force it this time and that
wasn&#8217;t the right way to do it. In the meantime, everything is working out
pretty awesomely.</p>

<p><strong>Goal: See a Space Shuttle Launch (in person)</strong><br/>
Result: Success - I hit a home run on this one. I watched the next to last
launch of Atlantis in May (from Titusville) and then I won the lottery by
being selected for the NASA Tweetup for Discovery&#8217;s final flight. While I
didn&#8217;t see Discovery launch (yet - 2011 goal now), I did get an amazing
experience at NASA including standing just a few hundred yards from Discovery
on the launchpad.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m OK with my progress (all things considered). I&#8217;m disappointed in
myself for not making progress on my &#8220;Get Healthy&#8221; goal, but it was a bit of a
crazy year. I&#8217;m happy with my direction heading into 2011 so 2010 was
definitely not a waste. While I may not have accomplished all of the goals I
wanted, 2011 is looking to be the best year yet.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most of you probably know I just spent a week down at NASA for the STS-133
Tweetup. 150 of us were down there to watch Discovery lift off for her final
flight. It was an amazing trip even though we didn&#8217;t get to see Discovery
launch (we may get a chance later). I&#8217;m going to post lots of info about the
trip and my thoughts about it, but I need a bit of time to catch up on things,
process my photos, and generally relax a bit. I&#8217;ll try to have some info up
late this week, but in the meantime, here are some things to check out:</p>

<p>We have a group setup on Flickr where lots of people are sending Tweetup
photos. If you&#8217;re curious about the things we saw, take a look here:</p>

    <link href="http://www.adambyram.com/2010/10/24/camping-at-elkmont/"/>
    <updated>2010-10-24T21:47:44-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adambyram.com/2010/10/24/camping-at-elkmont</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This weekend was my first time camping at Elkmont. My Dad &amp; I used to go
camping a good bit when I was little, so I thought he would like going camping
in the Smokies. I heard good things about Elkmont and they happened to have a
creekside site available for the weekend, so that&#8217;s what I reserved.</p>

<p>We arrived around 3pm on Saturday and got checked in pretty fast. Our campsite
was G11 which was just a quick trip down the road from the ranger station. We
had one of the small sites - just a tent pad, fire ring, a picnic table, and a
single parking spot. The tent went up pretty quickly, so we got small fire
going early in the evening and just sat around the campsite. We ended up
cooking some steaks and potatoes for dinner - the cooking part went fine, but
we didn&#8217;t bring quite enough light for the picnic table. We had plenty of
flashlights, but we didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d need a big lantern&#8230;turns out, the
potatoes &amp; steak took longer than we expected and it gets dark early&#8230;so we
basically ate in the dark. We stayed up pretty late (11:30-ish) and then
turned in for the night. We decided to cook some eggs &amp; bacon the following
morning, walked a good bit of the Elkmont site, and then headed out. A few
photos from the trip are here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fl%0Aickr.com/photos/adambyram/sets/72157625235026618/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/adambyram/sets/72157625235026618/</a></p>

<p>So what did I think? Well&#8230;</p>

<h3>Proximity to other campers</h3>

<p>I was surprised how close we were to other campers. Some of the areas seem to
be spaced out a bit more, but the &#8220;G&#8221; section was pretty packed. If you&#8217;re
wanting to get away from everything, Elkmont may not do it for you. I think
I&#8217;d like it more with a camper so some of the sounds are muffled. In a tent,
every foot step, car, motorcycle, kid&#8217;s bike, etc makes quite a bit of noise
and you can&#8217;t really escape it. Section &#8220;G&#8221; also allows generators during the
day, so quite a few sites had those going during the day.</p>

<h3>Pay attention to the rules (i.e. keep food safe)</h3>

<p>We didn&#8217;t have this problem, but some of our nearby campers did&#8230; The rules
you agree to when you reserve a spot state that you&#8217;ll keep your food locked
in your car at all times unless you&#8217;re physically with the food at the site.
Some guys a couple of sites over from us didn&#8217;t do this and left their cooler
our while they went for a motorcycle ride. Shortly after they left, the
rangers came by and confiscated all of their food (including the cooler
itself). On top of that, anyone caught breaking the rules is fined $75. So if
you camp at Elkmont, read &amp; follow by the rules&#8230;they are serious about them
and they really do patrol frequently to verify compliance.</p>

<h3>Jerks nearby</h3>

<p>So being in close proximity to other campers isn&#8217;t bad normally - it&#8217;s a
little noisier as I mentioned, but nothing too bad&#8230;unless you&#8217;re camping
next to jerks. I don&#8217;t know what was up with the people that were right next
to us at G9, but their freaking car alarm went on for minutes at a time FOUR
times during the night. Not right next to each other either - the first time
was around midnight and they seemed to happen nearly once an hour all the way
up to 3am. At that point, my Dad went over to talk to them and one of the
campers was out trying to quite the truck. I have no idea what was going on,
but a truck alarm blaring at 3am about 100 ft from your head is not awesome.
Another nearby camper told us the following morning that these people had the
alarm go off EIGHT times the night before! If you have great campers nearby,
this will be ok, but since you have no control over who camps next to you, you
should be aware that you too could have a jerk camper during your relaxing
camping experience.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>It was a good trip and we&#8217;ll probably be back to Elkmont in the future. I
didn&#8217;t really sleep at all due to cars going by (G11 is just across the Little
River from the entrance road to the campground and cars sound pretty loud),
some animal(s) around the campsite overnight (no idea what it was&#8230;but
something was walking around outside for a while late in the night), and the
freaking car alarm. The site was nice in general though and my Dad really
enjoyed it. I think my ideal wilderness retreat would be to go to a secluded
cabin with a great mountain view &amp; an internet connection&#8230;but I can
certainly deal with a regular camping trip every now and then.</p>

    <link href="http://www.adambyram.com/2010/10/22/back-to-basics/"/>
    <updated>2010-10-22T22:29:16-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adambyram.com/2010/10/22/back-to-basics</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you read my blog in the browser and not via RSS, you may notice the look
has changed a bit. Everything is streamlined and I have a more minimalist
style. The blog is back to nice looking, easy to read text with minimal
distractions. I&#8217;ve decided a lot of things in my life are too cluttered these
days, so I&#8217;m starting my decluttering right here on the web. In addition to
the style, I&#8217;ve also simplified the categories on the blog to focus on the
things I really care about - life, money (personal finance), photography, and
tech. I&#8217;ll expand those if the need arises, but having the categories this way
seems to give me a little more mental clarity. The RSS feed is also going
through FeedBurner now - your feed should have automatically swapped over, so
hopefully that won&#8217;t cause any issues.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also going to start blogging more. I know I&#8217;ve said that before, but I
mean it this time. I need to work on my writing and now I have more incentive
than normal since I do a good bit of tech writing at work. I can&#8217;t promise the
topics will always be interesting, but I have a lot of things I want to talk
about. I have quite a few folders of ideas to post, but I have been holding
them because I originally thought I&#8217;d have a different site for each topic,
but I&#8217;ve decided against that. It&#8217;s easier to keep all of the content in one
place and I&#8217;m more likely to write this way, so we&#8217;ll see how it goes. More to
come in the near future&#8230;stay tuned.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[iPhone 4 - Early Thoughts]]></title>
    <link href="http://www.adambyram.com/2010/06/28/iphone-4-early-thoughts/"/>
    <updated>2010-06-28T11:19:07-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adambyram.com/2010/06/28/iphone-4-early-thoughts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The main reasons I upgraded from my 3GS to iPhone 4:</p>

<ul>
<li>Retina display</li>
<li>Better battery life</li>
<li>Better camera</li>
</ul>


<h3>Retina</h3>

<p>The display is stunning - it is crystal clear and the colors are beautiful.
Most apps simply become more crisp (assuming they don&#8217;t use a lot of low-res
images). I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll see a ton of difference in the way you use apps
due to the display, but you&#8217;ll enjoy the experience much more and it&#8217;ll feel
less like a computer screen. This is one of those things where the old
technology got the job done just fine, but man, after using this display for a
few days now, I can&#8217;t wait to see it come to iPad and to traditional computer
monitors. Once you get used to retina, all other displays start looking really
blurry.</p>

<h3>Battery Life</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s excellent. It still isn&#8217;t going to last nearly as long as the iPad, but
it seems to last significantly longer than my 3GS did while performing the
same tasks.</p>

<h3>Camera</h3>

<p>For still photography, the camera seems to be improved, but it&#8217;s significantly
better at low light photography. This is partly due to the new sensor
technology, but it&#8217;s also due to the inclusion of a small LED flash. Don&#8217;t get
me wrong, the low light photos are terrible compared to a DSLR or even a mid-
range Point &amp; Shoot&#8230;but it&#8217;s a huge step up from the camera in the 3GS that
was barely usable in lower light conditions. Daylight photos (particularly
macro type shots) range from good to excellent. If you want proof, check out
this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pminton/4740503969/">shot</a> by a friend of
mine. I&#8217;d say that under optimal conditions, the iPhone 4&#8217;s still camera is
very competitive with mid-range Point &amp; Shoot cameras. As for video, it&#8217;s 720p
in size, but don&#8217;t expect anything close to Bluray quality. I put a couple of
<a href="http://vimeo.com/12805175">videos</a> on my Vimeo account&#8230;these are &#8220;worst
case&#8221; shots - indoors with low light shooting a dark subject with some fast
movement. Quality wise, the video function alone is right there with my
Creative Vado&#8230;there is absolutely no reason to use a Vado, Flip, etc. if you
have an iPhone 4. In fact, when you add on the software (iMovie or otherwise),
the iPhone 4 blows those devices out of the water.</p>

<h3>Overall Feel</h3>

<p>Compared to my 3GS, the iPhone 4 feels better &amp; worse. I love the new design -
it&#8217;s more sleek and feels even more solid. The downside is I feel more
paranoid that I&#8217;m going to drop it. With the 3GS, you could drop it and have a
pretty good chance of only minor scratches or maybe a small crack in the
plastic back. With the iPhone 4, you&#8217;re either going to damage the glass on
the front or back (and the camera is integrated into that back glass as well)
or you&#8217;re going to bang up the antennas (since they form the metal band around
the outside). In theory, the glass is super strong and not easy to break, but
something about it just feels a little more fragile. Speed wise, everything
feels fast. If you&#8217;ve used an iPad, it&#8217;s pretty much the same. I really don&#8217;t
notice a ton of speed increase over my 3GS for day to day activities - I do
know it&#8217;s much more powerful though, so I&#8217;m sure future apps will widen this
gap.</p>

<h3>FaceTime</h3>

<p>FaceTime is the video calling feature built-in to each iPhone 4. I tried it
out with a friend from Twitter and it&#8217;s certainly a nifty feature. It works as
easily as Apple advertises&#8230;call someone, touch a button, and boom - video
call. The big gotcha (for now) is that both parties must have iPhone 4s AND be
on a WiFi network. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll be using this feature all that much, but
I also prefer e-mail/twitter/IM to phone calls anyway. I can see it being
pretty popular for some people and I do see a few use cases for myself.</p>

<h3>iBooks</h3>

<p>iBooks is an app I use a ton on my iPad. I was hoping the retina display would
make it more readable to me on the iPhone 4. Text &amp; images looks absolutely
fantastic - but at the end of the day, I just can&#8217;t read on such a tiny
screen. It&#8217;s not that the font is too small - I can see it fine - I just can&#8217;t
fit enough content on the screen for my tastes. I read mostly technical (or at
least non-fiction books) though, so books with less structured content may be
a bit better. Imagine reading the tiny bibles you used to find in hotels -
that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s like reading on the iPhone 4&#8230;super crisp text, but a little
bitty reading surface. I do like having the ability to look up something in
iBooks in an emergency though - so I&#8217;ll keep it installed just in case.</p>

<h3>Multitasking</h3>

<p>A lot of people have been anxiously awaiting multitasking on iPhone. I&#8217;m not
one of them. I would like a few apps to be able to update in the background
(Twitter for example) and I&#8217;d like to have a live IM client, but that&#8217;s about
it. I don&#8217;t use Skype or Pandora on the phone, but if I did, I&#8217;d be happy. For
me, this is a nice feature, but the only real benefit I get is that it&#8217;s
slightly faster to switch between applications. Maybe I&#8217;ll be wow&#8217;d with what
people are able to do with this in the future, but for now, I just don&#8217;t see
much benefit for the tasks I do today&#8230;but I was never the target of this
feature in the first place.</p>

<h3>Reception</h3>

<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard about the reception issues with iPhone 4. Steve Jobs
said they don&#8217;t exist, but if they did, it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re holding it the
wrong way. Apple corporate said they exist on all phones and you should buy a
case. Well, they definitely do exist and I&#8217;m holding my phone the same way
I&#8217;ve held every Apple iPhone. I&#8217;m going to end up buying a case I&#8217;m sure, but
I&#8217;m really disappointed in Apple over this one. If you hold the phone in your
left hand, you&#8217;ll connect two of the antennas with your finger or palm. By
doing this, your 5 bars of full signal will drop to &#8220;No Service&#8221; within 30
seconds or so unless you happen to be <em>very</em> close to a cell tower. At home, I
can do this easily every time I try. In West Knoxville, I had a harder time
getting the signal to drop&#8230;so it seems to be partially dependent on your
proximity to cell towers. I have yet to have a call drop due to this, but I
have had SMS messages and data downloads stop/fail due to it&#8230;so it isn&#8217;t
just a display issue - it really is losing the signal. Apple says some type of
fix is on the way and if that&#8217;s the case, then maybe this won&#8217;t be a problem
much longer. I expected I would get better reception than my 3GS due to the
larger exposed antenna, but so far, my 3GS had a more stable signal. Call
quality is as good or better on the iPhone 4 though. I haven&#8217;t tried making a
call from a noisy area yet, but all of the calls I&#8217;ve made have sounded very
clear on my end and no complaints from those that I&#8217;ve called.</p>

    <link href="http://www.adambyram.com/2010/01/10/my-goals-the-2010-edition/"/>
    <updated>2010-01-10T00:55:06-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adambyram.com/2010/01/10/my-goals-the-2010-edition</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last year, I&#8217;ve been making a list of things I want to accomplish (or
at least think about accomplishing) in 2010. Now that 2010 is finally here,
it&#8217;s time to define my final list of goals. I ended up with 24 goals. It&#8217;s
unreasonable to think that I could focus on all 24 goals (plus any new ones
that come up during the year), so I&#8217;m only going to focus on three main goals.
I&#8217;m not going to ignore my other goals by any means, but these three items are
the places I&#8217;m going to focus 95% of my energy this year:</p>

<h2>Get healthy</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve learned a lot about healthier eating and exercise over the last year, but
I&#8217;ve failed at putting it into practice for an extended period of time. I want
to be healthier for quite a few good reasons and it&#8217;s time I step up and do
it. For this goal, my criteria are that I must be able to sustain the
lifestyle changes and my target weight is 175 (with a stretch goal of 150) by
the end of the year. (I know weight isn&#8217;t the only thing that makes one
&#8220;healthy&#8221;, but I&#8217;m going to use it as the measurable part of this goal
anyway.)</p>

<h2>Side income to livable levels</h2>

<p>I already make money on the side of my day job, but it&#8217;s not much&#8230;certainly
nowhere close to anything I can live off. For 2010, my goal is to find a
sustainable way to bring in $2500/mo after taxes. This goal isn&#8217;t to make that
much on the side <em>each</em> month this year, it&#8217;s to <em>start</em> doing it so I could
support myself fully in 2011&#8230;a proof of concept essentially. If I can hit
this amount, that works out to around $30K/yr which is all I need to live very
comfortably at this point in my life.</p>

<h2>See a Space Shuttle launch (in person)</h2>

<p>I went to space camp and I love NASA (and space exploration in general), but I
have yet to see a shuttle launch. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve always wanted to do, but
I&#8217;ve never made the time. There are only 5 shuttle launches left (as of right
now) and they all happen in 2010. I don&#8217;t care which launch I see, but I&#8217;m
going to see one in person (hopefully from the VIP area so I can get a good
view).</p>

    <link href="http://www.adambyram.com/2009/10/28/my-att-u-verse-experience-in-knoxville/"/>
    <updated>2009-10-28T13:01:25-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adambyram.com/2009/10/28/my-att-u-verse-experience-in-knoxville</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve had quite a few people ask about my recent AT&amp;T U-verse install, so I
thought a quick blog post was in order. Keep in mind, my install happened
during the first week of the Knoxville, TN U-verse rollout - so I&#8217;m sure
things will go faster (as far as the installation goes) as they do more and
more installs in this area.</p>

<p>I chose to go with U-verse because I live in an older neighborhood in
Knoxville and my high speed internet choices are fairly limited. I&#8217;ve had
3Mbps DSL from AT&amp;T for the last 3 years and it&#8217;s been decent, but I really
needed more upload speed. I&#8217;m a software developer so I usually have lots of
large software updates I need to download quite often and I frequently have
fairly large chunks of data I need to upload to a server on a regular basis
(Dropbox, Subversion, etc.). I ended up going with AT&amp;T U-verse since they
offer a package with 18Mbps download and 2Mbps upload&#8230;this was my main
consideration for choosing U-verse, not the VoIP service nor the TV service. I
want to make it clear that I didn&#8217;t compare the TV and phone services to other
providers&#8230;so if that is your main focus, this writeup may not be useful to
you.</p>

<p><strong>Speed Test - Before &amp; After</strong> <em>All tests were performed with www.speedtest.net on a MacBook running Snow Leopard connected to my wireless LAN - this is my most common usage scenario, so it&#8217;s what I decided to test with.  Also, ignore the &#8220;distance&#8221; in these speed tests&#8230;all were performed in Knoxville at the same location.</em></p>

<p>Before U-verse - Speed Test</p>

<p><a href="http://share.adambyram.com/2009-10-28-my-att-u-verse-experience-in-knoxville/SpeedTest-DSL.png"><img src="http://share.adambyram.com/2009-10-28-my-att-u-verse-experience-in-knoxville/SpeedTest-DSL.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>After U-verse - Speed Test</p>

<p><a href="http://share.adambyram.com/2009-10-28-my-att-u-verse-experience-in-knoxville/SpeedTest-Uverse.png"><img src="http://share.adambyram.com/2009-10-28-my-att-u-verse-experience-in-knoxville/SpeedTest-Uverse.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>From this quick test, you can see my download rate is much higher, but my
upload rate also got a massive improvement.  The ping time got cut in half as
well - so it&#8217;s a win-win-win with the U-verse upgrade.  The thing is, the
download rate isn&#8217;t anywhere near the max rate of 18Mbps, so I decided to try
a speed test against the Atlanta, GA data center since I would assume they
have more capacity than Morristown&#8230;</p>

<p>Speed Test - Atlanta</p>

<p><a href="http://share.adambyram.com/2009-10-28-my-att-u-verse-experience-in-knoxville/SpeedTest-Uverse2.png"><img src="http://share.adambyram.com/2009-10-28-my-att-u-verse-experience-in-knoxville/SpeedTest-Uverse2.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Nice huh?  That&#8217;s quite close to the max download rate and a very respectable
upload speed&#8230;and the ping is lower still.  So the bottom line is U-verse
blows regular DSL out of the water and it is generally better than cable or at
least very comparable.  One of the things I don&#8217;t like about cable internet is
they use different methods to boost your speeds for short periods of time.  So
you may have a 12Mbps package and for 30 secs - 2 minutes, you may get that
speed when starting a download, but if you&#8217;re downloading something large, you
will usually notice your download speed dialing back pretty
drastically&#8230;whereas I should (in theory) have these U-verse speeds
throughout the whole download.  Realistically though, you&#8217;re going to be very
unlikely to find a single server that can provide you with a download at these
rates, so the only way you would be able to get this much data flowing would
be to have quite a few downloads going on simultaneously.</p>

<p><strong>The Installation</strong><br/>
Now that the speed test is out of the way, you may want to know about the
installation process.  When I signed up for the install, I was told the
install takes between 4 to 6 hours depending on the services I wanted
installed and the specifics of my house/neighborhood.  The U-verse install
requires two different groups - one is an external group that hooks up your
new equipment on the outside of your house and the other group does everything
inside the house.  In my case, I heard from both groups at 9am - both called
to confirm the appointment and to let me know they were on the way.  The
external guy got here around 9:30am and he started checking the lines outside
my house.  The internal guys got here around 9:45am and I gave them a quick
tour of the places I wanted U-verse.  The external guy worked until 11 or a
little after getting everything prepped and getting some electronics added on
to my house that connect back up to the utility pole.  While he was doing
that, the internal guys explored the attic and crawlspace to determine the
best way to run my new wires.</p>

<p>I have an older house and even though I did have coax cables in most of the
rooms, the cables were always on the opposite wall from my TVs (I have not had
cable for over 3 years&#8230;so placement in relation to the cables wasn&#8217;t exactly
important prior to today).  After talking to the U-verse guys about this, they
agreed they should go ahead and run new wires to all of my TVs&#8230;but here&#8217;s
the awesome part: they ran Cat 5e cables to all my rooms <em>for free</em> instead of
coax!  That was a HUGE win for me&#8230;why?  Because now I can add a network
switch in any room with one of the new network jacks and I&#8217;ve got a way to
hardwire in my other goodies&#8230;specifically, my Xbox 360 and my Blu-ray
players.  If you already had coax cable that was close to your TVs, I don&#8217;t
think they would run anything for you since they prefer to use existing
wiring.  Even if they do run new stuff for your install, <em>you</em> must ask for
Cat 5e instead of coax if that is what you want.  They can install either one
usually unless there are specific environmental conditions at your location -
in which case they may not give you a choice.  Anyway, it took them maybe an
hour to hour and a half to run the network drops (I had four sets total in my
case&#8230;all from the crawlspace).</p>

<p>By this time, the outside stuff was done and tested.  Both teams must test the
line once it&#8217;s ready to go - until that point, you don&#8217;t really know whether
you can actually get U-verse service or not.  If you can&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t know what
happens&#8230;in my case, both teams agreed that I had an excellent signal here so
we could proceed with installation of the Residential Gateway (the &#8220;RG&#8221;).  So,
they finished up all of the network jacks (adding faceplates, etc.) and then
connected up the RG and the backup battery (a small Belkin UPS&#8230;keeps the net
and VoIP up for 4 hours if the power goes out).  The RG essentially <em>IS</em> the
U-verse service&#8230;it controls everything.  It has a router (wired and
wireless&#8230;b/g only), the VoIP system, and the TV connections.  So if this box
isn&#8217;t happy, nothing is going to work.  It&#8217;s important to note that this RG
box needs a true, three prong grounded electrical outlet&#8230;I have a 50 year
old home, but luckily a handful of my outlets were updated to be grounded just
before I bought this house.  If you&#8217;re thinking about U-verse and you have an
older house, make sure you have one of these outlets or you won&#8217;t be able to
install&#8230;you can&#8217;t use an adapter for this part, you <em>must</em> have a real
grounded outlet near the RG.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, my RG was not happy.  No matter what they did, it just
wouldn&#8217;t connect to the network.  The techs tried everything they could think
of, but after about 2 hours of troubleshooting it, they decided it we should
try another RG.  At this point, the installation was crossing the 7 hour mark
(the guys didn&#8217;t even take a lunch break&#8230;).  This time, the RG connected
properly.  Even when the RG works, the initial setup still takes about 15
minutes while it configures itself.  Once that was done, I had to connect to
the RG from my MacBook and finish a few last steps on the AT&amp;T website.  Once
all of that was out of the way, the techs connected up all of my TV boxes and
let them sync.  All of them had to perform an automatic update that took
another 10-15 minutes to complete.  Finally, we did a quick test of my phone
system, finished porting my number to the new system, and then they gave me a
quick tour of the U-verse software on the DVR.  It was 6:30pm and the
installation was completed.</p>

<p><strong>So, was it worth it?</strong><br/>
I&#8217;ve had the service for less than a day as I write this, but I can say that
this was 110% worth it for my purposes.  Heck, just getting these great upload
and download rates makes it worth it for me, but getting my house wired with a
wired gigabit network was an unbelievable bonus.  Will I watch all 450+ TV
channels?  No, I&#8217;ll probably watch 20 or less any given week.  If you like TV
though, this package has as much as any of them.  I don&#8217;t use the landline
phone much, so I&#8217;m not sure how useful the VoIP upgrade will be&#8230;call quality
sounds much better (I had some noise prior to this upgrade), but I wanted to
keep my Knoxville number, so I kept the phone service for the moment.  I think
a typical install in a newer home that already had existing coax (or ethernet)
cable in all the right places would be much, much shorter than my
install&#8230;maybe 2-4 hours.  So if you&#8217;re thinking about getting U-verse, don&#8217;t
let the length of my install deter you - it&#8217;s very unlikely it&#8217;ll take longer
than 6 hours max.  All of the guys I dealt with during the install were a
pleasure to work with - other than the technical issues with the bad RG
hardware, everything went as smoothly as one would want.  The real question is
the long term support - will AT&amp;T keep up the great customer service I
experienced or will they drop the ball now that I&#8217;m committed to U-verse?
Only time will tell, but I can certainly recommend U-verse at this point.</p>

<p>UPDATE (10/30/2009): It&#8217;s been a couple of days now and I&#8217;m still very happy
with the service.  The only &#8220;issue&#8221; I&#8217;ve found is that I misunderstood the
stream limit with U-verse as far as TV programming.  I thought all boxes would
be able to watch any channel (HD or SD) and the DVR box could do 4 channels
(all recording or watching 1 and recording 3).  What I didn&#8217;t realize was that
your entire U-verse system can only support 4 channels simultaneously and of
those 4, only 2 can be HD.  So if you have three boxes like I do, you can&#8217;t
watch live HD content on all three boxes at the same time unless you&#8217;re
watching the same show(s) on two or more of the boxes.  If you have lots of
TVs in your house, you may hit this issue pretty quickly.  In my case, I hit
the issue because three of the shows I like to watch come on at the same time
on the same day of the week&#8230;when I tried to set the DVR to record all of
them in HD, it told me I couldn&#8217;t.  I can drop one of the shows down to SD and
it&#8217;s fine, but while the recording is going on, I won&#8217;t be able to watch any
other channels in HD (it gives you a blue screen and tells you no more HD
channels can be used until the recording has stopped).  For me, this isn&#8217;t a
deal breaker, but I thought I should put a note on here since this limit
wasn&#8217;t clear to me&#8230;I knew the limit of 4 streams on the DVR box, I just
didn&#8217;t realize that was a limit on the whole U-verse install.</p>

    <updated>2009-09-16T20:27:08-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adambyram.com/2009/09/16/important-life-truths</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I ran across an article the other day that I thought would be worth sharing -
it&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.raptitude.com/2009/07/88-important-truths-ive-learned-about-%0Alife/">&#8220;88 Important Truths I’ve Learned About
Life&#8221;</a>. I don&#8217;t necessarily think 100% of these items are &#8220;truths&#8221; in my life,
but I&#8217;d say I can certainly agree with the vast majority of them. You should
read the whole article - but here were my top favorites (with my thoughts in
italics):</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>You can’t change other people, and it’s rude to try.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p><em>I learned this one pretty early on - it has proven very true in my
experience. The key is that <em>you</em> can&#8217;t change other people, but they <em>can</em>
change&#8230;they just have to do the changing themselves.</em></p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>Every problem you have is your responsibility, regardless of who caused
it.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p><em>I like this one a lot because too many people have a victim mentality. In the
end though, your problems are just that&#8230;<em>your</em> problems. You don&#8217;t have to
solve them if you don&#8217;t want to, but don&#8217;t forget that they are yours to solve
and yours alone.</em></p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>Credit card debt devours souls.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Ok - this one is a little over the top for me, but I agree in general. Credit
card debt (or any kind of debt for that matter) will almost always detract
from you achieving your goals. If you manage it correctly, it may only have a
negligible impact on your life, but if you don&#8217;t, it can easily destroy it. So
while I wouldn&#8217;t go so far as credit card debt &#8220;devours souls&#8221;, I do believe
that having it will, at some point, have a net negative impact on your life.</em></p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>Most of what we see is only what we think about what we see.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Out of all 88 items in the article, this is my favorite. Essentially,
everything you see is based around perception which means you&#8217;ll color
everything you see with your own beliefs, assumptions, and knowledge.
Sometimes things will actually be what you perceived, but most than likely,
you only have a portion of the total picture.</em></p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>Even if it costs no money, nothing is free if it takes time.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p><em>I don&#8217;t have anything special to add to this one - but I totally
agree&#8230;<em>nothing</em> is truly free.</em></p>

    <link href="http://www.adambyram.com/2009/07/03/finished-mass-effect/"/>
    <updated>2009-07-03T00:06:37-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.adambyram.com/2009/07/03/finished-mass-effect</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finally finished the main story in Mass Effect just a couple of days ago. I
think I have about 15 hours of game time in&#8230;which is pretty short, but I
didn&#8217;t do all that many of the side missions. The story was really excellent.
There were quite a few surprises along the way that really made things move
along nicely.</p>

<p>I think Final Fantasy 7 is still the best RPG I&#8217;ve played, but I would say
Mass Effect is in my overall top 10 games list. The only thing that never
really clicked for me was all of the equipment. Sure, you can buy fancy
weapons and and all kinds of upgrades, but I barely did any of that and the
game wasn&#8217;t that hard to beat. I suppose I could up the difficulty level and
maybe all of the equipment would matter more.</p>

<p>In any event, it&#8217;s a fun game if you like more action oriented RPGs. Depending
on your choices, it may feel a little too much like a FPS for some people, but
the balance seemed just about right to me. Now I can start watching for Mass
Effect 2 information&#8230;I&#8217;ve been trying to avoid it until I finished this just
to make sure I didn&#8217;t see any of the ending before it was time.</p>
