<div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I finally decided it is time for me to give Apple&#8217;s OS X a try. I&#8217;ve
been interested in seeing how things work on an Apple system, but I haven&#8217;t
really had a reason to buy an Apple machine. I still don&#8217;t <em>really</em> have a
reason, but I do want to play around with the iPhone SDK since I have some
ideas I&#8217;d like to try out so I used that as an excuse to buy a MacBook.</p>

<p>I ended up going with a black 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo version. It came with 2GB of
RAM, but that&#8217;s not really enough since I want to run VMWare Fusion so that I
can have Visual Studio 2005/2008 running in unity mode as well as SQL Server
2005/2008. So I had the MacBook upgraded to 4GB DDR2 RAM. Apple wanted $400
extra to add 2GB, but I used Crucial memory and did the upgrade myself for a
grand total of $111 including tax &amp; shipping. Not a bad deal since I
effectively saved nearly $300 by spending about 10 minutes swapping the RAM
sticks out.</p>

<p>So far, my impression of OS X is favorable. I&#8217;ve found replacements for
everything I typically used on Windows (except development tools and Quicken)
and I&#8217;m fairly happy with the way things work. For the first week or so, I
wasn&#8217;t sure that I was ever going to like OS X, but it&#8217;s one of those things
that grows on you. I wouldn&#8217;t make the claim that a lot of people when they
say Macs are easier to use than Windows. I think usability (as a whole) is
pretty similar between the two. OS X does have some standards that most
applications seem to follow which is better than on Windows, but the big
difference is that the &#8220;graphic arts&#8221; background of historical Mac users has
resulted in software developers taking more time to refine the user experience
to the point that things are a bit more logical than they are in Windows-based
counterparts.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really happy with the battery life on this thing. As long as I&#8217;m just
surfing the net, typing up blog posts, reading e-mail, and other light tasks,
I get fantastic battery life. I have a feeling even playing a DVD will still
result in good battery life, but it may not be the 4 or so hours I get now.
Time machine seems useful, although I keep forgetting to eject the disk before
I unplug the backup drive - so I think I&#8217;m going to end up getting the Time
Capsule before long, but I don&#8217;t really want to spend that money right now.</p>

<p>The one thing that is slightly disappointing thus far is that the MacBook gets
a little choppy when playing World of Warcraft with everything maxed out. It&#8217;s
not terrible and I do realize this machine has an integrated graphics card,
but WoW isn&#8217;t <em>that</em> demanding&#8230;either way, it&#8217;s still plenty playable, but
it&#8217;s just a little disappointing that it&#8217;s not as smooth as I&#8217;d like.</p>

<p>After I&#8217;ve used OS X for a few more weeks, I&#8217;ll post my updated impressions,
but so far so good.</p>
