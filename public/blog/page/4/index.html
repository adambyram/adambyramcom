	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>If you read my blog in the browser and not via RSS, you may notice the look
has changed a bit. Everything is streamlined and I have a more minimalist
style. The blog is back to nice looking, easy to read text with minimal
distractions. I&rsquo;ve decided a lot of things in my life are too cluttered these
days, so I&rsquo;m starting my decluttering right here on the web. In addition to
the style, I&rsquo;ve also simplified the categories on the blog to focus on the
things I really care about &ndash; life, money (personal finance), photography, and
tech. I&rsquo;ll expand those if the need arises, but having the categories this way
seems to give me a little more mental clarity. The RSS feed is also going
through FeedBurner now &ndash; your feed should have automatically swapped over, so
hopefully that won&rsquo;t cause any issues.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also going to start blogging more. I know I&rsquo;ve said that before, but I
mean it this time. I need to work on my writing and now I have more incentive
than normal since I do a good bit of tech writing at work. I can&rsquo;t promise the
topics will always be interesting, but I have a lot of things I want to talk
about. I have quite a few folders of ideas to post, but I have been holding
them because I originally thought I&rsquo;d have a different site for each topic,
but I&rsquo;ve decided against that. It&rsquo;s easier to keep all of the content in one
place and I&rsquo;m more likely to write this way, so we&rsquo;ll see how it goes. More to
come in the near future&hellip;stay tuned.</p>

			iPhone 4 - Early Thoughts</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The main reasons I upgraded from my 3GS to iPhone 4:</p>

<ul>
<li>Retina display</li>
<li>Better battery life</li>
<li>Better camera</li>
</ul>


<h3>Retina</h3>

<p>The display is stunning &ndash; it is crystal clear and the colors are beautiful.
Most apps simply become more crisp (assuming they don&rsquo;t use a lot of low-res
images). I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll see a ton of difference in the way you use apps
due to the display, but you&rsquo;ll enjoy the experience much more and it&rsquo;ll feel
less like a computer screen. This is one of those things where the old
technology got the job done just fine, but man, after using this display for a
few days now, I can&rsquo;t wait to see it come to iPad and to traditional computer
monitors. Once you get used to retina, all other displays start looking really
blurry.</p>

<h3>Battery Life</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s excellent. It still isn&rsquo;t going to last nearly as long as the iPad, but
it seems to last significantly longer than my 3GS did while performing the
same tasks.</p>

<h3>Camera</h3>

<p>For still photography, the camera seems to be improved, but it&rsquo;s significantly
better at low light photography. This is partly due to the new sensor
technology, but it&rsquo;s also due to the inclusion of a small LED flash. Don&rsquo;t get
me wrong, the low light photos are terrible compared to a DSLR or even a mid-
range Point &amp; Shoot&hellip;but it&rsquo;s a huge step up from the camera in the 3GS that
was barely usable in lower light conditions. Daylight photos (particularly
macro type shots) range from good to excellent. If you want proof, check out
this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pminton/4740503969/">shot</a> by a friend of
mine. I&rsquo;d say that under optimal conditions, the iPhone 4&rsquo;s still camera is
very competitive with mid-range Point &amp; Shoot cameras. As for video, it&rsquo;s 720p
in size, but don&rsquo;t expect anything close to Bluray quality. I put a couple of
<a href="http://vimeo.com/12805175">videos</a> on my Vimeo account&hellip;these are &ldquo;worst
case&rdquo; shots &ndash; indoors with low light shooting a dark subject with some fast
movement. Quality wise, the video function alone is right there with my
Creative Vado&hellip;there is absolutely no reason to use a Vado, Flip, etc. if you
have an iPhone 4. In fact, when you add on the software (iMovie or otherwise),
the iPhone 4 blows those devices out of the water.</p>

<h3>Overall Feel</h3>

<p>Compared to my 3GS, the iPhone 4 feels better &amp; worse. I love the new design &ndash;
it&rsquo;s more sleek and feels even more solid. The downside is I feel more
paranoid that I&rsquo;m going to drop it. With the 3GS, you could drop it and have a
pretty good chance of only minor scratches or maybe a small crack in the
plastic back. With the iPhone 4, you&rsquo;re either going to damage the glass on
the front or back (and the camera is integrated into that back glass as well)
or you&rsquo;re going to bang up the antennas (since they form the metal band around
the outside). In theory, the glass is super strong and not easy to break, but
something about it just feels a little more fragile. Speed wise, everything
feels fast. If you&rsquo;ve used an iPad, it&rsquo;s pretty much the same. I really don&rsquo;t
notice a ton of speed increase over my 3GS for day to day activities &ndash; I do
know it&rsquo;s much more powerful though, so I&rsquo;m sure future apps will widen this
gap.</p>

<h3>FaceTime</h3>

<p>FaceTime is the video calling feature built-in to each iPhone 4. I tried it
out with a friend from Twitter and it&rsquo;s certainly a nifty feature. It works as
easily as Apple advertises&hellip;call someone, touch a button, and boom &ndash; video
call. The big gotcha (for now) is that both parties must have iPhone 4s AND be
on a WiFi network. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll be using this feature all that much, but
I also prefer e-mail/twitter/IM to phone calls anyway. I can see it being
pretty popular for some people and I do see a few use cases for myself.</p>

<h3>iBooks</h3>

<p>iBooks is an app I use a ton on my iPad. I was hoping the retina display would
make it more readable to me on the iPhone 4. Text &amp; images looks absolutely
fantastic &ndash; but at the end of the day, I just can&rsquo;t read on such a tiny
screen. It&rsquo;s not that the font is too small &ndash; I can see it fine &ndash; I just can&rsquo;t
fit enough content on the screen for my tastes. I read mostly technical (or at
least non-fiction books) though, so books with less structured content may be
a bit better. Imagine reading the tiny bibles you used to find in hotels &ndash;
that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like reading on the iPhone 4&hellip;super crisp text, but a little
bitty reading surface. I do like having the ability to look up something in
iBooks in an emergency though &ndash; so I&rsquo;ll keep it installed just in case.</p>

<h3>Multitasking</h3>

<p>A lot of people have been anxiously awaiting multitasking on iPhone. I&rsquo;m not
one of them. I would like a few apps to be able to update in the background
(Twitter for example) and I&rsquo;d like to have a live IM client, but that&rsquo;s about
it. I don&rsquo;t use Skype or Pandora on the phone, but if I did, I&rsquo;d be happy. For
me, this is a nice feature, but the only real benefit I get is that it&rsquo;s
slightly faster to switch between applications. Maybe I&rsquo;ll be wow&rsquo;d with what
people are able to do with this in the future, but for now, I just don&rsquo;t see
much benefit for the tasks I do today&hellip;but I was never the target of this
feature in the first place.</p>

<h3>Reception</h3>

<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard about the reception issues with iPhone 4. Steve Jobs
said they don&rsquo;t exist, but if they did, it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re holding it the
wrong way. Apple corporate said they exist on all phones and you should buy a
case. Well, they definitely do exist and I&rsquo;m holding my phone the same way
I&rsquo;ve held every Apple iPhone. I&rsquo;m going to end up buying a case I&rsquo;m sure, but
I&rsquo;m really disappointed in Apple over this one. If you hold the phone in your
left hand, you&rsquo;ll connect two of the antennas with your finger or palm. By
doing this, your 5 bars of full signal will drop to &ldquo;No Service&rdquo; within 30
seconds or so unless you happen to be <em>very</em> close to a cell tower. At home, I
can do this easily every time I try. In West Knoxville, I had a harder time
getting the signal to drop&hellip;so it seems to be partially dependent on your
proximity to cell towers. I have yet to have a call drop due to this, but I
have had SMS messages and data downloads stop/fail due to it&hellip;so it isn&rsquo;t
just a display issue &ndash; it really is losing the signal. Apple says some type of
fix is on the way and if that&rsquo;s the case, then maybe this won&rsquo;t be a problem
much longer. I expected I would get better reception than my 3GS due to the
larger exposed antenna, but so far, my 3GS had a more stable signal. Call
quality is as good or better on the iPhone 4 though. I haven&rsquo;t tried making a
call from a noisy area yet, but all of the calls I&rsquo;ve made have sounded very
clear on my end and no complaints from those that I&rsquo;ve called.</p>

		<p>I know I don&rsquo;t post very much to this blog&hellip;I never have really. I can&rsquo;t
quite figure out a good use for my domain. I post a reasonable amount on

<a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> a try. It&rsquo;s a microblogging site &ndash; there is no
140 character limit like there is on Twitter, but it&rsquo;s setup in a way that
encourages quick, focused posts. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll stay active with it or
not, but since I don&rsquo;t have a good way to integrate my Tumblr posts into this
blog, I wanted to give you guys the direct link for any that are interested in

<p>Today I resigned from my job at the small software startup.  I&rsquo;m not going to
go into the details as to why I left, but I&rsquo;ll just say that I don&rsquo;t regret
joining the company, but I feel I may have regretted it if I stayed any longer
due to various things (including some opportunities outside of the company).</p>

			My Goals - the 2010 Edition</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Over the last year, I&rsquo;ve been making a list of things I want to accomplish (or
at least think about accomplishing) in 2010. Now that 2010 is finally here,
it&rsquo;s time to define my final list of goals. I ended up with 24 goals. It&rsquo;s
unreasonable to think that I could focus on all 24 goals (plus any new ones
that come up during the year), so I&rsquo;m only going to focus on three main goals.
I&rsquo;m not going to ignore my other goals by any means, but these three items are
the places I&rsquo;m going to focus 95% of my energy this year:</p>

<h2>Get healthy</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about healthier eating and exercise over the last year, but
I&rsquo;ve failed at putting it into practice for an extended period of time. I want
to be healthier for quite a few good reasons and it&rsquo;s time I step up and do
it. For this goal, my criteria are that I must be able to sustain the
lifestyle changes and my target weight is 175 (with a stretch goal of 150) by
the end of the year. (I know weight isn&rsquo;t the only thing that makes one
&ldquo;healthy&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;m going to use it as the measurable part of this goal
anyway.)</p>

<h2>Side income to livable levels</h2>

<p>I already make money on the side of my day job, but it&rsquo;s not much&hellip;certainly
nowhere close to anything I can live off. For 2010, my goal is to find a
sustainable way to bring in $2500/mo after taxes. This goal isn&rsquo;t to make that
much on the side <em>each</em> month this year, it&rsquo;s to <em>start</em> doing it so I could
support myself fully in 2011&hellip;a proof of concept essentially. If I can hit
this amount, that works out to around $30K/yr which is all I need to live very
comfortably at this point in my life.</p>

<h2>See a Space Shuttle launch (in person)</h2>

<p>I went to space camp and I love NASA (and space exploration in general), but I
have yet to see a shuttle launch. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do, but
I&rsquo;ve never made the time. There are only 5 shuttle launches left (as of right
now) and they all happen in 2010. I don&rsquo;t care which launch I see, but I&rsquo;m
going to see one in person (hopefully from the VIP area so I can get a good
view).</p>
