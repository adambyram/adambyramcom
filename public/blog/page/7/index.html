			iPhone Apps</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, about three months ago, I applied for the Apple iPhone Developer Program
so I could build a few apps for my iPhone.  Last Friday, I was finally
approved.  I&rsquo;m not sure why it took so long for Apple to open things up, but
I&rsquo;m glad they finally released the finished SDK and let everyone in.  I&rsquo;m sure
in the next couple of months, there will be some awesome applications out
there.  I&rsquo;ve been working most of the weekend on my first app, but I&rsquo;ll talk
more about that later.</p>

<p>I did notice that one of the top 10 apps (#9 currently) is &ldquo;iBeer&rdquo; &ndash; it uses
the iPhone&#8217;s accelerometer to display &ldquo;beer&rdquo; on the iPhone&rsquo;s screen that looks
as if it were in a glass when you tip the iPhone up to your mouth.  I think
it&rsquo;s an interesting use of the hardware and all, but I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s a
top 10 <strong>non-free</strong> app.  I mean, this thing costs $3 + tax&hellip;  Just amazing
what people value these days (but congratz to the developer for coming up with
that &ndash; paying off big time I&rsquo;m sure).</p>

			Ok, So I Lied - Back to Mac & WinXP</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Yesterday, I posted about how I was giving up OS X after 3 months of use.
Well, after 24 hours of use, I remembered why I tried to switch to mac to
start with&hellip;activation.  I&rsquo;m one of those people that likes to reformat a
machine when it&rsquo;s getting too much crud &ndash; after all, as a software developer,
I try out new things when they come out and that&rsquo;s not really a good thing for
the system if you want to keep it clean and fast.  The problem, is that I
don&rsquo;t really want to tie Vista to my MacBook since I may want to go back to OS
X at some point&hellip;  I remembered I had my dual core Athlon 64 desktop w/
triple monitors just sitting in a closet, so found some desk space and fired
it up.  It&rsquo;s so much easier to get my .NET development on using my desktop.
I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s just habit, but it just doesn&rsquo;t feel right on the laptop (and I
miss my third screen).</p>

<p>So, now my MacBook is transitioning back to OS X Leopard (looking forward to
Snow Leopard though if they really do speed things up), but my main workhorse
is my trusty old desktop.  I really hate not using Vista since I purchased it
at retail, but XP just feels better (and Vista doesn&rsquo;t like my desktop&hellip;but
XP flies on it thanks to the ton o&#8217; RAM and 10K RPM SATA drive).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really surprised that I didn&rsquo;t like having a dedicated Vista laptop, but
it just didn&rsquo;t feel right once everything was said and done.  With this new
setup, things seem just right&hellip;old habits die hard.</p>

			Going Back to Vista After 3 Months of OS X</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&rsquo;s been about 3 months since I purchased by MacBook.  Since then, I&rsquo;ve been
using OS X Leopard as my main OS at home &ndash; the only exception was when I
needed to pop back to Quicken 2006.  Overall, OS X wasn&rsquo;t a bad experience,
but there wasn’t anything magical about it either.</p>

<p>Perhaps jumping into OS X with Leopard was the wrong thing to do.  I&rsquo;ve read
quite a lot about how Tiger was a very streamlined and efficient OS and how
Leopard came along and added bloat.  I&rsquo;ve had very little experience with
Tiger (or earlier versions) of OS X, so I can&rsquo;t compare first hand, however, I
can confirm that Vista Ultimate 64-bit runs much faster than OS X Leopard on
this MacBook, which is a shame.  From what I&rsquo;ve seen, Leopard has plenty of
flashy effects along with a few nice features (e.g. Time Machine), but the
bottom line is that I&rsquo;m not more productive using a Mac.  I realize that part
of that is caused by the fact that I&rsquo;ve been a Windows power user for quite a
long time.  The other part of that, is that Mac apps in general are fun to use
and nice to look at, but your options in that software are very limited.  I
thought I would like the simplicity of Mail, iCal, and Address Book, but the
reality is that I miss Outlook &ndash; there&rsquo;s something nice about having one
application open instead of 3.</p>

<p>The other catch is that I&rsquo;ve stopped doing development at home because it&rsquo;s a
bit of a hassle to switch to the BootCamp partition whenever I want to play
around with .NET.  I tried VMWare Fusion and it worked great until I tried to
resize the Vista partition, then VMWare got confused and couldn&rsquo;t figure out
how to boot Vista.  I realize these are petty items, the reality is that I&rsquo;m
still tied to MS and using OS X right now just gets in the way (I can buy
another dedicated MS PC, but I don&rsquo;t see a reason to do that at this point).
My day job is at a Microsoft shop, my financial software is Windows based, my
hobby development is usually in .NET as well, so it&rsquo;s just so much easier to
just stay in the MS OS world.</p>

<p>Secondary reasons for the move are the fact that Vista just plain runs better
on the MacBook that Leopard ever did.  Leopard wasn&rsquo;t super sluggish, but it
was never all that snappy.  The other reason is that everything on Mac seems
to cost more &ndash; the hardware is comparable to higher end PC prices, but it
seems like all the basic applications I liked would all cost $30-$70 a pop.
Which isn&rsquo;t that expensive, but it just feels like even the little things are
a bit pricy.  Maybe that&rsquo;s just perception though &ndash; I know the tools I use on
Vista aren&rsquo;t cheap either (in fact, they are much, much more expensive than
the equivalent Mac software), but the reality is that I already own them.</p>

<p>In any event, I just finished by MacBook reformat so now I&rsquo;m up and running
with Vista and it feels like home &ndash; it may not be quite as fun to use, but for
me, it&rsquo;s really about the productivity, and that is one thing Vista can handle
just fine.</p>

			Thoughts on iPhone 2.0</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about whether it will be worth it to pick up an iPhone 2.0
on July 11th.  I&rsquo;ve had the original iPhone for a while now (I picked it up
when they discontinued the 4GB version) and I have mixed feelings about it.
iPhone 1.0 is certainly the best PDA type phone I&rsquo;ve ever used.  Everything is
very well designed, the battery life is good, sound quality is at least as
good as other phones I&rsquo;ve had, the web browser is fantastic (unless you need
to view Flash content), and it&rsquo;s a great iPod.</p>

<p>So why am I not already getting in line for 2.0?  Well, the first thing is
that the 2.0 software will run on the 1.0 hardware.  So any bug fixes, new
core application updates (e.g. scientific calculator), and other improvements
will work just fine on my original phone.  The only real hardware features
that matter for version 2.0 of the hardware are 3G network chip and the A-GPS
hardware.</p>

<p>2G is certainly not setting any speed records &ndash; but for the most part, it gets
the job done fine for me.  I use the web more on the iPhone than I have on any
other phone, but it&rsquo;s still nothing at all compared to my web use on a real PC
&ndash; so 3G would be nice, but it&rsquo;s nothing I can&rsquo;t live without.  The main issue
with the 3G support is that my phone bill will go up by $10 per month for 2
years &ndash; so $240 total increase on top of buying the $200/$300 iPhone 2.0.
It&rsquo;s not a horrible price increase, but in my particular situation, it&rsquo;s
harder to justify the benefit outweighing the cost there.</p>

<p>The A-GPS is a bit more appealing though.  I have a handheld GPS unit from
Garmin, but it&rsquo;s meant for hiking/geocaching type activities and not for
navigation.  I do like the idea of buying a cheap dash mount and then my
iPhone could be a very decent auto navigation system that moves around to
different cars easily.  Of course, this all depends on what GPS software is
released for the phone, but I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll see great things in this area.  The
other thing is that we really haven&rsquo;t had a small GPS device that had an
always on broadband-link internet link &ndash; that could allow for all kinds of
interesting situations that make the GPS ability of the iPhone unlike anything
we&rsquo;ve seen (for better or for worse).</p>

<p>At this point, my feeling is that I&rsquo;m going to hold off for a bit and see what
applications come out that make use of iPhone 2.0 hardware features.  If they
are compelling enough, then I may make the jump, but I&rsquo;m starting to get to
that point where I need to see real world benefits from new gadgets instead of
just the conceptual greatness of them…  Even on July 11th, the really amazing
applications for iPhone may not even be ready because of the way Apple has
chosen to limit the developer program &ndash; from the latest Apple keynote, it
sounds like some developers (and some SDK functionality) won&rsquo;t even be ready
until September anyway.  We&rsquo;ll see how things play out, but for now, I think
I&rsquo;ll be keeping my $440.</p>

			Writing Takes Longer Than I Thought</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, I&rsquo;m still working on my new blogs based on personal finance and
technology. So far, I have about 20 posts planned out for the personal finance
one, but I haven&rsquo;t touched the technology one yet. I&rsquo;ve been toying with
writing my own blog engine for the technology one &ndash; not because there aren&rsquo;t
good blog engines out there, but more as a learning exercise (and it would use
some of the newer .Net features that the other blog engines haven&rsquo;t used yet).
I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m going to do that now or not&hellip;</p>

<p>I have maybe 3 personal finance posts written, but still need to proofread
them before I make them public. My original plan was to not post anything on
the personal finance site until I have about 14 posts ready to go so I can
queue them up and start writing the next week or two worth of posts. That&rsquo;s
still my plan as of right now, but this is going to be harder than I imagined
as far as keeping fresh content coming out. My target is to have one new
article a day during the week. I just have to figure out a rhythm and then
hopefully it&rsquo;ll get easier, but I guess we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p>I may go ahead and start the tech site as well with a series of posts about
building a new blog engine. I&rsquo;m not sure that I want to do that or not, but it
may be useful and having feedback on the design as I go along would be
helpful. Just have to find the time to do that too.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been trying to get back into the habit of taking more photos and
getting a little photoblog up and running, but I think that one is on the back
burner for now. Just not enough time to do everything.</p>
