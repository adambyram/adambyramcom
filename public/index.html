  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really thought I&#8217;d have a lot to blog about since this whole week was a
pretty crazy cross country adventure&#8230;but I can&#8217;t seem to focus on blogging
at the moment.  I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s just a writer&#8217;s block thing or what.
Whenever I sit down to write, I keep thinking I&#8217;m writing out some formal
document and that ends up causing me to keep thinking about it and then I just
stop.  My goal is to blog <em>more</em> now that I&#8217;m out in LA and I have lots of
friends around the country that will probably be interested in updates.  At
this point, I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;m going to do.  I thought about just using
Tumblr instead of my own custom WordPress install or I may simply start fresh
with this domain.  I&#8217;ll definitely find a way to send out updates on my LA
adventure, but it looks like it&#8217;ll be a little bit longer.</p>

<p>One quick update though - I did make it to LA just fine and both kitties made
it smoothly.  My furniture isn&#8217;t here yet, so my apartment is basically empty
at the moment, but at least I&#8217;m here.  I&#8217;ll post more in the near future, but
so far, so good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today is my last day of work on the East Coast. It&#8217;s a sad day since I&#8217;m
leaving a stable company full of good people and interesting opportunities. At
the same time, it&#8217;s an exciting day since I&#8217;m leaving so I can prepare myself
for the 2200 mile move to Los Angeles before I start my dream job of building
spaceships. I never thought I&#8217;d be trading my reasonably large house in
Tennessee and basically all of my stuff for a tiny one bedroom apartment in
LA, but I never thought I&#8217;d be able to work on spaceships either.</p>

<p>I got a great send off from my coworkers. A few of them decided to do a little
decorating to my cube&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few guys I know decided to start a photo group on Flickr called Alter
Oculos. It&#8217;s a group for sharing photowalk images and trying out some photo
projects as a group. This week, we decided to all use the same set of shots,
but then we&#8217;ll all process them and compare our take on the post processing.
These are my two finished images. I think the first turned out ok, but I
really like the second image quite a lot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This year, I&#8217;m setting 5 major goals for myself. I have several other
behaviors to change/actions to take this year, but I&#8217;m only considering these
five items my goals since they are realistic, actionable, and measurable.</p>

<h3>Release a new app or website</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working on several ideas over the last year or so and I&#8217;m going to
really push to get at least one new project released publicly. I&#8217;m not going
to be more specific other than the new &#8220;thing&#8221; will must be something anyone
can sign up for or download. Open source, closed source, free, or paid -
doesn&#8217;t matter - I just want to complete v1.0 of a new project.</p>

<h3>Max out 401K &amp; Roth IRA</h3>

<p>Pretty simple - $16,500 pre-tax dollars into the 401K and $5,000 of after-tax
dollars into a Roth IRA.</p>

<h3>Lose weight</h3>

<p>Nothing special about this goal. I&#8217;m targeting 35 pounds lost by the end of
the year. I&#8217;ve had this one on my goal list for a while, so it&#8217;s time to
finally knock this one off.</p>

<h3>Write a journal entry a day</h3>

<p>This is a new one for me. I wanted to do a 365 photo project, but I&#8217;d really
like to do more writing&#8230;so a 365 writing project it is. I won&#8217;t be
publishing these, but I&#8217;m really enjoying it so far (even though I&#8217;m only 3
days in).</p>

<p>2011 feels different from years past, so I have pretty high hopes for
accomplishing these goals (as well as several other things).</p>

<time datetime="2010-12-28T23:57:51-08:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 28<span>th</span>, 2010</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in January, I posted my [top three goals for
2010.](http://www.adambyram.com/2010/01/10/my-goals-the-2010-edition/</p>

<p>)</p>

<p>So how did I do? Well&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Goal: Get Healthy</strong><br/>
Result: Failed - I totally bombed this one. A lot of changes happened in 2010
that distracted me from this goal. This WILL be happening in 2011.</p>

<p><strong>Goal: Side Income to Livable Levels</strong><br/>
Result: Success / Not Applicable - This originally came about because I wanted
to leave me previous job and work for myself. I did end up working for myself
anyway, but I didn&#8217;t get my side income to livable levels. Having said that, I
did start a new job which negated this goal (and resulted in an even better
outcome in a lot of ways). I still love the idea of running my own business
and maybe it&#8217;ll happen when it&#8217;s time. I tried to force it this time and that
wasn&#8217;t the right way to do it. In the meantime, everything is working out
pretty awesomely.</p>

<p><strong>Goal: See a Space Shuttle Launch (in person)</strong><br/>
Result: Success - I hit a home run on this one. I watched the next to last
launch of Atlantis in May (from Titusville) and then I won the lottery by
being selected for the NASA Tweetup for Discovery&#8217;s final flight. While I
didn&#8217;t see Discovery launch (yet - 2011 goal now), I did get an amazing
experience at NASA including standing just a few hundred yards from Discovery
on the launchpad.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m OK with my progress (all things considered). I&#8217;m disappointed in
myself for not making progress on my &#8220;Get Healthy&#8221; goal, but it was a bit of a
crazy year. I&#8217;m happy with my direction heading into 2011 so 2010 was
definitely not a waste. While I may not have accomplished all of the goals I
wanted, 2011 is looking to be the best year yet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of you probably know I just spent a week down at NASA for the STS-133
Tweetup. 150 of us were down there to watch Discovery lift off for her final
flight. It was an amazing trip even though we didn&#8217;t get to see Discovery
launch (we may get a chance later). I&#8217;m going to post lots of info about the
trip and my thoughts about it, but I need a bit of time to catch up on things,
process my photos, and generally relax a bit. I&#8217;ll try to have some info up
late this week, but in the meantime, here are some things to check out:</p>

<p>We have a group setup on Flickr where lots of people are sending Tweetup
photos. If you&#8217;re curious about the things we saw, take a look here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/group%0As/sts133tweetup/pool/">http://www.flickr.com/groups/sts133tweetup/pool/</a></p>

<p>If you want to see <em>exactly</em> what we saw, you get watch the Justin.tv stream
of pretty much the whole tweetup right here (note - lots of videos here&#8230;not
official NASA videos and lots of them are from the parties. I know the actual
tweetup content is in here somewhere though):</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all for now. More to come in a couple of days.</p>

<time datetime="2010-10-24T21:47:44-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 24<span>th</span>, 2010</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>This weekend was my first time camping at Elkmont. My Dad &amp; I used to go
camping a good bit when I was little, so I thought he would like going camping
in the Smokies. I heard good things about Elkmont and they happened to have a
creekside site available for the weekend, so that&#8217;s what I reserved.</p>

<p>We arrived around 3pm on Saturday and got checked in pretty fast. Our campsite
was G11 which was just a quick trip down the road from the ranger station. We
had one of the small sites - just a tent pad, fire ring, a picnic table, and a
single parking spot. The tent went up pretty quickly, so we got small fire
going early in the evening and just sat around the campsite. We ended up
cooking some steaks and potatoes for dinner - the cooking part went fine, but
we didn&#8217;t bring quite enough light for the picnic table. We had plenty of
flashlights, but we didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d need a big lantern&#8230;turns out, the
potatoes &amp; steak took longer than we expected and it gets dark early&#8230;so we
basically ate in the dark. We stayed up pretty late (11:30-ish) and then
turned in for the night. We decided to cook some eggs &amp; bacon the following
morning, walked a good bit of the Elkmont site, and then headed out. A few
photos from the trip are here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fl%0Aickr.com/photos/adambyram/sets/72157625235026618/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/adambyram/sets/72157625235026618/</a></p>

<p>So what did I think? Well&#8230;</p>

<h3>Proximity to other campers</h3>

<p>I was surprised how close we were to other campers. Some of the areas seem to
be spaced out a bit more, but the &#8220;G&#8221; section was pretty packed. If you&#8217;re
wanting to get away from everything, Elkmont may not do it for you. I think
I&#8217;d like it more with a camper so some of the sounds are muffled. In a tent,
every foot step, car, motorcycle, kid&#8217;s bike, etc makes quite a bit of noise
and you can&#8217;t really escape it. Section &#8220;G&#8221; also allows generators during the
day, so quite a few sites had those going during the day.</p>

<h3>Pay attention to the rules (i.e. keep food safe)</h3>

<p>We didn&#8217;t have this problem, but some of our nearby campers did&#8230; The rules
you agree to when you reserve a spot state that you&#8217;ll keep your food locked
in your car at all times unless you&#8217;re physically with the food at the site.
Some guys a couple of sites over from us didn&#8217;t do this and left their cooler
our while they went for a motorcycle ride. Shortly after they left, the
rangers came by and confiscated all of their food (including the cooler
itself). On top of that, anyone caught breaking the rules is fined $75. So if
you camp at Elkmont, read &amp; follow by the rules&#8230;they are serious about them
and they really do patrol frequently to verify compliance.</p>

<h3>Jerks nearby</h3>

<p>So being in close proximity to other campers isn&#8217;t bad normally - it&#8217;s a
little noisier as I mentioned, but nothing too bad&#8230;unless you&#8217;re camping
next to jerks. I don&#8217;t know what was up with the people that were right next
to us at G9, but their freaking car alarm went on for minutes at a time FOUR
times during the night. Not right next to each other either - the first time
was around midnight and they seemed to happen nearly once an hour all the way
up to 3am. At that point, my Dad went over to talk to them and one of the
campers was out trying to quite the truck. I have no idea what was going on,
but a truck alarm blaring at 3am about 100 ft from your head is not awesome.
Another nearby camper told us the following morning that these people had the
alarm go off EIGHT times the night before! If you have great campers nearby,
this will be ok, but since you have no control over who camps next to you, you
should be aware that you too could have a jerk camper during your relaxing
camping experience.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>It was a good trip and we&#8217;ll probably be back to Elkmont in the future. I
didn&#8217;t really sleep at all due to cars going by (G11 is just across the Little
River from the entrance road to the campground and cars sound pretty loud),
some animal(s) around the campsite overnight (no idea what it was&#8230;but
something was walking around outside for a while late in the night), and the
freaking car alarm. The site was nice in general though and my Dad really
enjoyed it. I think my ideal wilderness retreat would be to go to a secluded
cabin with a great mountain view &amp; an internet connection&#8230;but I can
certainly deal with a regular camping trip every now and then.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you read my blog in the browser and not via RSS, you may notice the look
has changed a bit. Everything is streamlined and I have a more minimalist
style. The blog is back to nice looking, easy to read text with minimal
distractions. I&#8217;ve decided a lot of things in my life are too cluttered these
days, so I&#8217;m starting my decluttering right here on the web. In addition to
the style, I&#8217;ve also simplified the categories on the blog to focus on the
things I really care about - life, money (personal finance), photography, and
tech. I&#8217;ll expand those if the need arises, but having the categories this way
seems to give me a little more mental clarity. The RSS feed is also going
through FeedBurner now - your feed should have automatically swapped over, so
hopefully that won&#8217;t cause any issues.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also going to start blogging more. I know I&#8217;ve said that before, but I
mean it this time. I need to work on my writing and now I have more incentive
than normal since I do a good bit of tech writing at work. I can&#8217;t promise the
topics will always be interesting, but I have a lot of things I want to talk
about. I have quite a few folders of ideas to post, but I have been holding
them because I originally thought I&#8217;d have a different site for each topic,
but I&#8217;ve decided against that. It&#8217;s easier to keep all of the content in one
place and I&#8217;m more likely to write this way, so we&#8217;ll see how it goes. More to
come in the near future&#8230;stay tuned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The main reasons I upgraded from my 3GS to iPhone 4:</p>

<ul>
<li>Retina display</li>
<li>Better battery life</li>
<li>Better camera</li>
</ul>


<h3>Retina</h3>

<p>The display is stunning - it is crystal clear and the colors are beautiful.
Most apps simply become more crisp (assuming they don&#8217;t use a lot of low-res
images). I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll see a ton of difference in the way you use apps
due to the display, but you&#8217;ll enjoy the experience much more and it&#8217;ll feel
less like a computer screen. This is one of those things where the old
technology got the job done just fine, but man, after using this display for a
few days now, I can&#8217;t wait to see it come to iPad and to traditional computer
monitors. Once you get used to retina, all other displays start looking really
blurry.</p>

<h3>Battery Life</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s excellent. It still isn&#8217;t going to last nearly as long as the iPad, but
it seems to last significantly longer than my 3GS did while performing the
same tasks.</p>

<h3>Camera</h3>

<p>For still photography, the camera seems to be improved, but it&#8217;s significantly
better at low light photography. This is partly due to the new sensor
technology, but it&#8217;s also due to the inclusion of a small LED flash. Don&#8217;t get
me wrong, the low light photos are terrible compared to a DSLR or even a mid-
range Point &amp; Shoot&#8230;but it&#8217;s a huge step up from the camera in the 3GS that
was barely usable in lower light conditions. Daylight photos (particularly
macro type shots) range from good to excellent. If you want proof, check out
this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pminton/4740503969/">shot</a> by a friend of
mine. I&#8217;d say that under optimal conditions, the iPhone 4&#8217;s still camera is
very competitive with mid-range Point &amp; Shoot cameras. As for video, it&#8217;s 720p
in size, but don&#8217;t expect anything close to Bluray quality. I put a couple of
<a href="http://vimeo.com/12805175">videos</a> on my Vimeo account&#8230;these are &#8220;worst
case&#8221; shots - indoors with low light shooting a dark subject with some fast
movement. Quality wise, the video function alone is right there with my
Creative Vado&#8230;there is absolutely no reason to use a Vado, Flip, etc. if you
have an iPhone 4. In fact, when you add on the software (iMovie or otherwise),
the iPhone 4 blows those devices out of the water.</p>

<h3>Overall Feel</h3>

<p>Compared to my 3GS, the iPhone 4 feels better &amp; worse. I love the new design -
it&#8217;s more sleek and feels even more solid. The downside is I feel more
paranoid that I&#8217;m going to drop it. With the 3GS, you could drop it and have a
pretty good chance of only minor scratches or maybe a small crack in the
plastic back. With the iPhone 4, you&#8217;re either going to damage the glass on
the front or back (and the camera is integrated into that back glass as well)
or you&#8217;re going to bang up the antennas (since they form the metal band around
the outside). In theory, the glass is super strong and not easy to break, but
something about it just feels a little more fragile. Speed wise, everything
feels fast. If you&#8217;ve used an iPad, it&#8217;s pretty much the same. I really don&#8217;t
notice a ton of speed increase over my 3GS for day to day activities - I do
know it&#8217;s much more powerful though, so I&#8217;m sure future apps will widen this
gap.</p>

<h3>FaceTime</h3>

<p>FaceTime is the video calling feature built-in to each iPhone 4. I tried it
out with a friend from Twitter and it&#8217;s certainly a nifty feature. It works as
easily as Apple advertises&#8230;call someone, touch a button, and boom - video
call. The big gotcha (for now) is that both parties must have iPhone 4s AND be
on a WiFi network. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll be using this feature all that much, but
I also prefer e-mail/twitter/IM to phone calls anyway. I can see it being
pretty popular for some people and I do see a few use cases for myself.</p>

<h3>iBooks</h3>

<p>iBooks is an app I use a ton on my iPad. I was hoping the retina display would
make it more readable to me on the iPhone 4. Text &amp; images looks absolutely
fantastic - but at the end of the day, I just can&#8217;t read on such a tiny
screen. It&#8217;s not that the font is too small - I can see it fine - I just can&#8217;t
fit enough content on the screen for my tastes. I read mostly technical (or at
least non-fiction books) though, so books with less structured content may be
a bit better. Imagine reading the tiny bibles you used to find in hotels -
that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s like reading on the iPhone 4&#8230;super crisp text, but a little
bitty reading surface. I do like having the ability to look up something in
iBooks in an emergency though - so I&#8217;ll keep it installed just in case.</p>

<h3>Multitasking</h3>

<p>A lot of people have been anxiously awaiting multitasking on iPhone. I&#8217;m not
one of them. I would like a few apps to be able to update in the background
(Twitter for example) and I&#8217;d like to have a live IM client, but that&#8217;s about
it. I don&#8217;t use Skype or Pandora on the phone, but if I did, I&#8217;d be happy. For
me, this is a nice feature, but the only real benefit I get is that it&#8217;s
slightly faster to switch between applications. Maybe I&#8217;ll be wow&#8217;d with what
people are able to do with this in the future, but for now, I just don&#8217;t see
much benefit for the tasks I do today&#8230;but I was never the target of this
feature in the first place.</p>

<h3>Reception</h3>

<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard about the reception issues with iPhone 4. Steve Jobs
said they don&#8217;t exist, but if they did, it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re holding it the
wrong way. Apple corporate said they exist on all phones and you should buy a
case. Well, they definitely do exist and I&#8217;m holding my phone the same way
I&#8217;ve held every Apple iPhone. I&#8217;m going to end up buying a case I&#8217;m sure, but
I&#8217;m really disappointed in Apple over this one. If you hold the phone in your
left hand, you&#8217;ll connect two of the antennas with your finger or palm. By
doing this, your 5 bars of full signal will drop to &#8220;No Service&#8221; within 30
seconds or so unless you happen to be <em>very</em> close to a cell tower. At home, I
can do this easily every time I try. In West Knoxville, I had a harder time
getting the signal to drop&#8230;so it seems to be partially dependent on your
proximity to cell towers. I have yet to have a call drop due to this, but I
have had SMS messages and data downloads stop/fail due to it&#8230;so it isn&#8217;t
just a display issue - it really is losing the signal. Apple says some type of
fix is on the way and if that&#8217;s the case, then maybe this won&#8217;t be a problem
much longer. I expected I would get better reception than my 3GS due to the
larger exposed antenna, but so far, my 3GS had a more stable signal. Call
quality is as good or better on the iPhone 4 though. I haven&#8217;t tried making a
call from a noisy area yet, but all of the calls I&#8217;ve made have sounded very
clear on my end and no complaints from those that I&#8217;ve called.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know I don&#8217;t post very much to this blog&#8230;I never have really. I can&#8217;t
quite figure out a good use for my domain. I post a reasonable amount on
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/adambyram">Twitter</a> these days, so I thought I&#8217;d give
<a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> a try. It&#8217;s a microblogging site - there is no
140 character limit like there is on Twitter, but it&#8217;s setup in a way that
encourages quick, focused posts. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll stay active with it or
not, but since I don&#8217;t have a good way to integrate my Tumblr posts into this
blog, I wanted to give you guys the direct link for any that are interested in
follow me there. Here&#8217;s the URL:</p>
