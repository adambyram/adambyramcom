  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the end of last month, I paid off my student loans - it was quite hard to
write a $14,000 check, but once it was written, I didn&#8217;t regret it at all. It
feels great knowing they are out of the way. The only debt I have left at this
point (other than my primary mortgage) is a second mortgage I got when I
bought my house (my down payment didn&#8217;t go as far as I had hoped due to
closing costs, new house expenses, etc). This one is higher than my student
loans ($18,000), but it&#8217;s possible that I can knock it out by the end of the
year assuming no major financial issues arise between now and then. I may end
up having to sell some stuff to make this happen, but we&#8217;ll see how that
goes&#8230;I&#8217;m willing to do what is needed to take care of business.</p>

<p>This morning I sent in my monthly payment with a nice little $500 additional
principle attached and I&#8217;m already starting to feel better. :) Debt free, here
I come!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love <a href="http://www.scifi.com/rewind/">Sci Fi Rewind</a> - I haven&#8217;t had cable TV
for two years now and the one show I wanted to watch, but couldn&#8217;t find
legally online was Battlestar Galactica.  Now Sci Fi finally has it online for
free on Rewind.  BSG may have been on there earlier, but I never found it
until this season.  The thing I really like about Rewind is the fact that the
commercialsare short and the video automatically resumes once the commercials
are over.  I like ABC.com&#8217;s quality (particularly the HD feeds - really nice
video), but I really dislike having to click the done button once the ad is
over&#8230;I&#8217;m just fine with the ads, but please, show them and then get out of
the way.  I&#8217;m glad to see Sci Fi understands this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Wordpress 2.5 / New Theme</strong><br/>
I just finished updating this blog to use the new Wordpress 2.5 engine. It&#8217;s
really quite nice - everything on the admin side is much more refined that
before. The upgrade process is amazingly simple - you just upload the new
files, run upgrade.php, and in a minute or two (or longer if you have lots of
posts) you&#8217;re ready to go. While I was doing the upgrade, I decide I would go
ahead and update the theme as well. I liked the last theme, but I saw a new
theme that looked a little better to me - so I just popped it in since I was
already messing around with the site anyway. It is a bit more streamlined than
the last one and more my style.</p>

<p><strong>New Blogs</strong><br/>
Over the last week or so, I&#8217;ve been planning out some topics that I want to
blog about. I realize I haven&#8217;t been actively blogging for a while now, but
part of that is because I can&#8217;t decide what I want to include on this blog.
I&#8217;m always torn between putting all of my thoughts on this one blog or trying
to keep them on different blogs so that each blog has a particular topic. The
problem is that I would end up not posting at all. So, I have finally decided
I&#8217;m going to dedicate time each week (and perhaps more often) to blogging in
general and I have also decided I am creating more focused blogs going
forward. At this point in time, I&#8217;m going to start maintaining three different
blogs:</p>

<p><em>AdamByram.com</em></p>

<p>This blog will continue to be blog that is purely personal - more to
communicate with friends and such than anything else. If I have a topic that I
want to talk about that doesn&#8217;t fit into either of the two new blogs, it&#8217;ll
end up here.</p>

<p><em>New Personal Finance Site</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ll announce the name later once I finish getting things setup and get the
initial content loaded, but I&#8217;m creating a new site focused on providing
personal finance advice / observations for Generation Y. My generation has the
opportunity to do great things, but I keep hearing (and seeing) how so many in
this generation can&#8217;t (or don&#8217;t want) to manage money. To me, this is one of
the most important things someone can learn. Money isn&#8217;t the key to happiness,
but it&#8217;s one of those things what you need to understand and learn to use to
help you achieve your dreams. So I&#8217;m hoping my new site will prove useful to
people that want to start learning about personal finance, but don&#8217;t want to
get bogged down in the technical details of it.</p>

<p><em>New Software Development Site</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ll announce the URL for this once it&#8217;s up and running as well, but this will
be the place that all of my software development related ideas will go. At the
end of 2007, I started a new job at a software startup and I&#8217;ve had many
experiences there that I&#8217;d like to blog about (as far as what works, what
doesn&#8217;t, and things I&#8217;m learning about). I&#8217;ve wanted to do a blog like this
for a long time, so we&#8217;ll see how it goes, but I think it&#8217;ll be fun.</p>

<p><strong>I Tweet</strong><br/>
I have also started using Twitter. I seems like a nice way to stay on top of
the latest happenings, particularly in the software world. I don&#8217;t tweet non-
stop or anything, but I try to tweet every now and then. I have my latest
tweets in the sidebar of this blog and you&#8217;re welcome to follow me on Twitter
if you&#8217;ve like -
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/adambyram">http://www.twitter.com/adambyram/</a>.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all for now - more updates to come.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just spent a few hours working on a small iPhone app using the Beta 2 iPhone
SDK and thought I would share my my initial thoughts. Keep in mind that this
is the first time I&#8217;ve tried programming for OS X period and I spend 99% of my
time programming in C# with Microsoft&#8217;s Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Xcode itself is not even comparable to Visual Studio (I realize VS isn&#8217;t free,
but even the free Express Editions are much, MUCH better than Xcode). I found
out how to turn on the autocomplete functionality in Xcode, but it&#8217;s so
unhelpful that I may turn it back off since it seems to get in the way more
than it helps. I&#8217;m so accustomed to intellisense in VS - if you know nothing
about a library, you can use intellisense to get up and running in a flash
(usually), but not in Xcode. In Xcode, if you don&#8217;t know the frameworks you&#8217;re
using in and out, prepare to be checking out Safari constantly. The whole
Interface Builder application doesn&#8217;t really make sense to me yet, so I won&#8217;t
really comment on it yet. The error messages from Xcode have been fairly
useful so far, so that&#8217;s a good thing. The editor is decent in that it color
codes syntax for you and it does have the ability to jump directly to specific
functions from a menu (very similar to VS on this one).</p>

<p>Perhaps the bigger issue for people coming from a non-OS X background is the
knowledge of all of the frameworks. It&#8217;s not nearly as expansive as the .NET
framework, but it&#8217;s quite different - so you&#8217;re not going to be able to just
pick up the frameworks and hit the ground running. The documentation on
Apple&#8217;s dev center isn&#8217;t terrible&#8230;it takes a little bit to find what you
need, but it&#8217;s usually there somewhere. The naming convention does make it
pretty clear what you&#8217;re doing when calling a method, however, this is
realllllllly irritating without intellisense. I&#8217;m still trying to figure out
which classes do what and how to structure the View/Controllers in my
application. The sample apps are really helping out there. It does seem like I
have to write quite a bit of code for even fairly basic stuff. I just feel
really unproductive at this point..I know that&#8217;s mostly the learning curve
that I&#8217;m working through, but I would have thought Apple would have a better
developer toolset in this day and age. I don&#8217;t think the Objective-C language
will be that hard to pickup since it seems pretty logical once you get the
syntax for methods and method calls. The frameworks are going to take some
time and I&#8217;m sure things will still be changing between now and June, but
hopefully I&#8217;ll get this stuff figured out soon so I can have my little app up
and running in the simulator.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t normally blog about random things I see on the internet, but I ran
across an article by John C. Dvorak today (<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2278816,00.asp">The iPhone Is No
Desktop</a>) that really
annoyed me enough that I have to do this. John is basically saying that it&#8217;s
ridiculous that people are using the iPhone as a desktop computing platform
and that drives him crazy in many ways (10 ways to be exact). I don&#8217;t disagree
that the iPhone is not a &#8220;desktop replacement&#8221; in the typical sense, but what
bothers me is the fact that he thinks this is important.</p>

<p>In the technical world, so many people still believe the &#8220;platform&#8221; is the key
to everything. There are always discussions about which platform is the best -
laptop vs desktop vs PDA, Windows vs OS X vs Linux, Nikon vs Canon, Ford vs
Chevy - you get the point. That&#8217;s all fine and dandy and I don&#8217;t disagree that
sometimes there are certain benefits to using a specific platform. But the
kicker is that this is a stupid argument to begin with.</p>

<p>People don&#8217;t care about the platform. Even if you think you care, you probably
don&#8217;t when you get right down to it. For example, when I&#8217;m using the Windows
platform, I keep my current TODO list in Microsoft Outlook. Now that I also
work on a Mac, I decided to move my TODO list to an
<a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com">online</a> platform. Sure - I moved to a
different &#8220;platform&#8221; because it made it easier to get to my TODO list from
either OS, but it&#8217;s not the platform I really care about, it&#8217;s the data.</p>

<p>Whether my TODO list is on the web, on my desktop, on my iPhone, or on my
physical notepad, the platform is of little importance to me as long as my
list is there and it&#8217;s accessible when I need it. The platform only comes into
the picture when it can better enable me to manipulate my data in ways that
make me more efficient and effective. In reality, forget the platform and
focus on the data (or on the actions driven by the data) and you&#8217;ll see that
the platform being the key is a fallacy in this day and age.</p>
