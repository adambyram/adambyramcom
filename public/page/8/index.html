  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just spent a few hours working on a small iPhone app using the Beta 2 iPhone
SDK and thought I would share my my initial thoughts. Keep in mind that this
is the first time I&#8217;ve tried programming for OS X period and I spend 99% of my
time programming in C# with Microsoft&#8217;s Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Xcode itself is not even comparable to Visual Studio (I realize VS isn&#8217;t free,
but even the free Express Editions are much, MUCH better than Xcode). I found
out how to turn on the autocomplete functionality in Xcode, but it&#8217;s so
unhelpful that I may turn it back off since it seems to get in the way more
than it helps. I&#8217;m so accustomed to intellisense in VS - if you know nothing
about a library, you can use intellisense to get up and running in a flash
(usually), but not in Xcode. In Xcode, if you don&#8217;t know the frameworks you&#8217;re
using in and out, prepare to be checking out Safari constantly. The whole
Interface Builder application doesn&#8217;t really make sense to me yet, so I won&#8217;t
really comment on it yet. The error messages from Xcode have been fairly
useful so far, so that&#8217;s a good thing. The editor is decent in that it color
codes syntax for you and it does have the ability to jump directly to specific
functions from a menu (very similar to VS on this one).</p>

<p>Perhaps the bigger issue for people coming from a non-OS X background is the
knowledge of all of the frameworks. It&#8217;s not nearly as expansive as the .NET
framework, but it&#8217;s quite different - so you&#8217;re not going to be able to just
pick up the frameworks and hit the ground running. The documentation on
Apple&#8217;s dev center isn&#8217;t terrible&#8230;it takes a little bit to find what you
need, but it&#8217;s usually there somewhere. The naming convention does make it
pretty clear what you&#8217;re doing when calling a method, however, this is
realllllllly irritating without intellisense. I&#8217;m still trying to figure out
which classes do what and how to structure the View/Controllers in my
application. The sample apps are really helping out there. It does seem like I
have to write quite a bit of code for even fairly basic stuff. I just feel
really unproductive at this point..I know that&#8217;s mostly the learning curve
that I&#8217;m working through, but I would have thought Apple would have a better
developer toolset in this day and age. I don&#8217;t think the Objective-C language
will be that hard to pickup since it seems pretty logical once you get the
syntax for methods and method calls. The frameworks are going to take some
time and I&#8217;m sure things will still be changing between now and June, but
hopefully I&#8217;ll get this stuff figured out soon so I can have my little app up
and running in the simulator.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t normally blog about random things I see on the internet, but I ran
across an article by John C. Dvorak today (<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2278816,00.asp">The iPhone Is No
Desktop</a>) that really
annoyed me enough that I have to do this. John is basically saying that it&#8217;s
ridiculous that people are using the iPhone as a desktop computing platform
and that drives him crazy in many ways (10 ways to be exact). I don&#8217;t disagree
that the iPhone is not a &#8220;desktop replacement&#8221; in the typical sense, but what
bothers me is the fact that he thinks this is important.</p>

<p>In the technical world, so many people still believe the &#8220;platform&#8221; is the key
to everything. There are always discussions about which platform is the best -
laptop vs desktop vs PDA, Windows vs OS X vs Linux, Nikon vs Canon, Ford vs
Chevy - you get the point. That&#8217;s all fine and dandy and I don&#8217;t disagree that
sometimes there are certain benefits to using a specific platform. But the
kicker is that this is a stupid argument to begin with.</p>

<p>People don&#8217;t care about the platform. Even if you think you care, you probably
don&#8217;t when you get right down to it. For example, when I&#8217;m using the Windows
platform, I keep my current TODO list in Microsoft Outlook. Now that I also
work on a Mac, I decided to move my TODO list to an
<a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com">online</a> platform. Sure - I moved to a
different &#8220;platform&#8221; because it made it easier to get to my TODO list from
either OS, but it&#8217;s not the platform I really care about, it&#8217;s the data.</p>

<p>Whether my TODO list is on the web, on my desktop, on my iPhone, or on my
physical notepad, the platform is of little importance to me as long as my
list is there and it&#8217;s accessible when I need it. The platform only comes into
the picture when it can better enable me to manipulate my data in ways that
make me more efficient and effective. In reality, forget the platform and
focus on the data (or on the actions driven by the data) and you&#8217;ll see that
the platform being the key is a fallacy in this day and age.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I finally decided it is time for me to give Apple&#8217;s OS X a try. I&#8217;ve
been interested in seeing how things work on an Apple system, but I haven&#8217;t
really had a reason to buy an Apple machine. I still don&#8217;t <em>really</em> have a
reason, but I do want to play around with the iPhone SDK since I have some
ideas I&#8217;d like to try out so I used that as an excuse to buy a MacBook.</p>

<p>I ended up going with a black 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo version. It came with 2GB of
RAM, but that&#8217;s not really enough since I want to run VMWare Fusion so that I
can have Visual Studio 2005/2008 running in unity mode as well as SQL Server
2005/2008. So I had the MacBook upgraded to 4GB DDR2 RAM. Apple wanted $400
extra to add 2GB, but I used Crucial memory and did the upgrade myself for a
grand total of $111 including tax &amp; shipping. Not a bad deal since I
effectively saved nearly $300 by spending about 10 minutes swapping the RAM
sticks out.</p>

<p>So far, my impression of OS X is favorable. I&#8217;ve found replacements for
everything I typically used on Windows (except development tools and Quicken)
and I&#8217;m fairly happy with the way things work. For the first week or so, I
wasn&#8217;t sure that I was ever going to like OS X, but it&#8217;s one of those things
that grows on you. I wouldn&#8217;t make the claim that a lot of people when they
say Macs are easier to use than Windows. I think usability (as a whole) is
pretty similar between the two. OS X does have some standards that most
applications seem to follow which is better than on Windows, but the big
difference is that the &#8220;graphic arts&#8221; background of historical Mac users has
resulted in software developers taking more time to refine the user experience
to the point that things are a bit more logical than they are in Windows-based
counterparts.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really happy with the battery life on this thing. As long as I&#8217;m just
surfing the net, typing up blog posts, reading e-mail, and other light tasks,
I get fantastic battery life. I have a feeling even playing a DVD will still
result in good battery life, but it may not be the 4 or so hours I get now.
Time machine seems useful, although I keep forgetting to eject the disk before
I unplug the backup drive - so I think I&#8217;m going to end up getting the Time
Capsule before long, but I don&#8217;t really want to spend that money right now.</p>

<p>The one thing that is slightly disappointing thus far is that the MacBook gets
a little choppy when playing World of Warcraft with everything maxed out. It&#8217;s
not terrible and I do realize this machine has an integrated graphics card,
but WoW isn&#8217;t <em>that</em> demanding&#8230;either way, it&#8217;s still plenty playable, but
it&#8217;s just a little disappointing that it&#8217;s not as smooth as I&#8217;d like.</p>

<p>After I&#8217;ve used OS X for a few more weeks, I&#8217;ll post my updated impressions,
but so far so good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today was the first time I have ever changed the oil in my Explorer at home
without help.  In the past, I always took it to Ford to have the service done
- but I don&#8217;t like the Ford dealerships around here, so I wanted to do it
myself.  So last time I needed to change my oil, my Dad came up and helped me
change it.  His help was basically him doing the work, but me watching so I
had some idea of what was going on.  I&#8217;ve been overdue for a change for a bit,
so I decided to bite the bullet and just go for it today.  It really isn&#8217;t
that bad - I think the worst part of the whole thing is picking the proper oil
filter (there are tons of options out there).</p>

<p>The whole process of draining the oil is simple (just make sure you find the
correct drain plug&#8230;there may be more than just the oil one and if you pick
the wrong one&#8230;well&#8230;it probably wouldn&#8217;t be very pretty).  All you really
do is remove the plug, let the oil drain, replace the plug, remove the filter,
let remaining oil drain (if any), install the new filter, then just fill it
back up with fresh oil.  It is a bit messy, but I would rather spend 30
minutes doing it myself than to spend 1-2 hours (mostly waiting) for someone
else to do it - and you can save quite a bit of money depending on how cheap
you want to be.  (I think my total costs are about the same as the dealer, but
they could be way less if I tried and didn&#8217;t mind cheaper materials&#8230;)</p>

<p>Overall, the whole process is quite fun.  I think I&#8217;m going to start learning
more about cars now - they don&#8217;t seem that hard to understand&#8230;there are lots
of parts, but each part is pretty simple by itself.  We&#8217;ll see how it goes,
but hopefully I&#8217;ll learn enough that I can start to work on my car more to fix
the little issues that are popping up these days.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, it&#8217;s been nearly 2 months since I last blogged&#8230;  I&#8217;ve had quite a few
things going on in those two months, probably as much or more than when I
first moved to TN.  I started remodeling my kitchen - the counter-tops will be
delivered on Friday if all goes as planned, then I&#8217;ll get the sink in and
things will be all good.  I also changed jobs - I went from a relatively huge
public company with 55K-ish employees to a little bitty private software
company.  It&#8217;s been quite a change, but it&#8217;s great - it&#8217;s exactly the type of
job I was looking for and I&#8217;m enjoying the people there (although I do still
miss the people at the previous employer).  Overall though, it was the right
move and I have no regrets.  Anyway - I plan to start blogging a few times a
week at least from now on, but we&#8217;ll see what happens.</p>
