  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today was the first time I have ever changed the oil in my Explorer at home
without help.  In the past, I always took it to Ford to have the service done
- but I don&#8217;t like the Ford dealerships around here, so I wanted to do it
myself.  So last time I needed to change my oil, my Dad came up and helped me
change it.  His help was basically him doing the work, but me watching so I
had some idea of what was going on.  I&#8217;ve been overdue for a change for a bit,
so I decided to bite the bullet and just go for it today.  It really isn&#8217;t
that bad - I think the worst part of the whole thing is picking the proper oil
filter (there are tons of options out there).</p>

<p>The whole process of draining the oil is simple (just make sure you find the
correct drain plug&#8230;there may be more than just the oil one and if you pick
the wrong one&#8230;well&#8230;it probably wouldn&#8217;t be very pretty).  All you really
do is remove the plug, let the oil drain, replace the plug, remove the filter,
let remaining oil drain (if any), install the new filter, then just fill it
back up with fresh oil.  It is a bit messy, but I would rather spend 30
minutes doing it myself than to spend 1-2 hours (mostly waiting) for someone
else to do it - and you can save quite a bit of money depending on how cheap
you want to be.  (I think my total costs are about the same as the dealer, but
they could be way less if I tried and didn&#8217;t mind cheaper materials&#8230;)</p>

<p>Overall, the whole process is quite fun.  I think I&#8217;m going to start learning
more about cars now - they don&#8217;t seem that hard to understand&#8230;there are lots
of parts, but each part is pretty simple by itself.  We&#8217;ll see how it goes,
but hopefully I&#8217;ll learn enough that I can start to work on my car more to fix
the little issues that are popping up these days.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, it&#8217;s been nearly 2 months since I last blogged&#8230;  I&#8217;ve had quite a few
things going on in those two months, probably as much or more than when I
first moved to TN.  I started remodeling my kitchen - the counter-tops will be
delivered on Friday if all goes as planned, then I&#8217;ll get the sink in and
things will be all good.  I also changed jobs - I went from a relatively huge
public company with 55K-ish employees to a little bitty private software
company.  It&#8217;s been quite a change, but it&#8217;s great - it&#8217;s exactly the type of
job I was looking for and I&#8217;m enjoying the people there (although I do still
miss the people at the previous employer).  Overall though, it was the right
move and I have no regrets.  Anyway - I plan to start blogging a few times a
week at least from now on, but we&#8217;ll see what happens.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had my 4GB iPhone for about a month now so I thought I would share my
impressions now that I&#8217;ve had plenty of time to check things out.  Overall,
I&#8217;m still very happy with my purchase, but there are a few annoying things:</p>

<p><strong>No Tasklist.</strong>  I don&#8217;t know why Apple decided to include all of the other PIM applications (contacts, calendar, notes), but decided to leave off a tasklist.  I really miss that feature from my Windows Mobile phone.  Hopefully Apple will add this soon.<br/>
<strong>Random Crashes.  </strong>It isn&#8217;t clear why it happens, but every once in a while, the iPhone will freeze and I&#8217;ll have to reboot.  Most of the time, I can just use the home button to kill the application and things are fine (although you usually lose whatever data you were updating, if any, when you do this).  It doesn&#8217;t take long to reset (maybe 20 seconds), but it&#8217;s still a bit of a pain.  My Windows Mobile phone and my PocketPC seem more stable (and I don&#8217;t have non-Apple applications on my phone).<br/>
<strong>No local downloading.</strong>  You can browse anything you want via Safari, but you can&#8217;t save anything.  I had one time when I really wanted to save a PDF document for viewing later or even e-mail it to myself&#8230;but the iPhone doesn&#8217;t support that.<br/>
<strong>No copy &amp; paste.  </strong>There have been a couple of times when I needed to take a snippit of a webpage (or even copy a URL) and paste it into a note or e-mail, but at present, there is no ability to copy and paste on the iPhone.<br/>
Of coure, there are still the original issues of not having Flash support and
no Assisted GPS.</p>

<p>But other than these few issues, the phone really works well.  The photo
viewer works great, the call quality has been excellent, the EDGE network in
my area is certainly speedy enough for everything I&#8217;ve needed, and the battery
life is better than I expected.  It may not be the perfect phone, but it&#8217;s
certainly a step in the right direction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a loyal reader of Business 2.0 for quite a few years now.  It is one
of the only magazines to which I subscribe.  I really look forward to getting
it each month to see all of the new business ideas and to read the magazine&#8217;s
take on various things.  Well, I just received my October copy and this is the
end of the road for Business 2.0.  Apparently they never figured out how to
get/keep advertisers interested in the magazine and it the magazine&#8217;s parent
company decided it didn&#8217;t bring in enough cash to trouble with keeping the
magazine alive.  Some of the staff are going to write for Fortune, but I just
don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll be the same.  All of the other magazines are stuffed with
ads, so I may buy a 100 page magazine, but only 40 of the pages are actual
content&#8230;and I&#8217;m not interested in flipping through ad after ad to find a
handful of stories that interest me - so I doubt I&#8217;ll pick up a subscription
to anything else to replace Business 2.0.  Oh well, it was good while it
lasted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while back, I posted that I made the move to 64-bit Vista.  Then I got an
iPhone, which doesn&#8217;t have 64-bit drivers, so I downgraded to Vista 32-bit.
Well, this weekend, I have had another ordeal - I just finished installing
32-bit Vista again.  My primary hard drive is beginning to fail apparently -
it did have a handful of bad sectors.  I&#8217;m fine with that, except Vista
refused to boot up so I can do a couple of things like de-activate iTunes,
check for any files that I may need to save (mainly installers - I keep all
data on a different drive), etc.  Well - after trying to boot into Vista in
every way I could think of, I decided I&#8217;ll go ahead and reinstall.  Guess what
- the install DVD fails to startup as well!  It would try to startup, but then
it would hang at the loading screen (black screen with the little green
progress bar at the bottom).  It appears that Vista&#8217;s boot process (from DVD
or HDD) can be hung when there is a corrupted partion.  I can understand the
HDD install not booting, but come on - why can&#8217;t the DVD boot?</p>

<p>I ended up getting an iso of the <a href="http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/">Ultimate Boot
CD</a>, running SeaTools to fix up the drive, and
then using the disk partioning tools there to wipe the drive clean.  After
that, the Vista DVD was able to boot just fine and now I&#8217;m finally back up and
running.  This is one of the reasons I keep wanting to switch to Apple though
- I know they have issues as well, but I can&#8217;t believe the various issues I
keep hitting with Vista&#8230;granted, I&#8217;m a power user so I don&#8217;t expect most of
the issues I see would cause a problem with &#8220;normal&#8221; home users, but geez,
it&#8217;s bad when I&#8217;m tempted to downgrade back to XP at least once a week.</p>
