			New Addition to the Family - Bought a MacBook</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, I finally decided it is time for me to give Apple&rsquo;s OS X a try. I&rsquo;ve
been interested in seeing how things work on an Apple system, but I haven&rsquo;t
really had a reason to buy an Apple machine. I still don&rsquo;t <em>really</em> have a
reason, but I do want to play around with the iPhone SDK since I have some
ideas I&rsquo;d like to try out so I used that as an excuse to buy a MacBook.</p>

<p>I ended up going with a black 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo version. It came with 2GB of
RAM, but that&rsquo;s not really enough since I want to run VMWare Fusion so that I
can have Visual Studio 2005/2008 running in unity mode as well as SQL Server
2005/2008. So I had the MacBook upgraded to 4GB DDR2 RAM. Apple wanted $400
extra to add 2GB, but I used Crucial memory and did the upgrade myself for a
grand total of $111 including tax &amp; shipping. Not a bad deal since I
effectively saved nearly $300 by spending about 10 minutes swapping the RAM
sticks out.</p>

<p>So far, my impression of OS X is favorable. I&rsquo;ve found replacements for
everything I typically used on Windows (except development tools and Quicken)
and I&rsquo;m fairly happy with the way things work. For the first week or so, I
wasn&rsquo;t sure that I was ever going to like OS X, but it&rsquo;s one of those things
that grows on you. I wouldn&rsquo;t make the claim that a lot of people when they
say Macs are easier to use than Windows. I think usability (as a whole) is
pretty similar between the two. OS X does have some standards that most
applications seem to follow which is better than on Windows, but the big
difference is that the &ldquo;graphic arts&rdquo; background of historical Mac users has
resulted in software developers taking more time to refine the user experience
to the point that things are a bit more logical than they are in Windows-based
counterparts.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really happy with the battery life on this thing. As long as I&rsquo;m just
surfing the net, typing up blog posts, reading e-mail, and other light tasks,
I get fantastic battery life. I have a feeling even playing a DVD will still
result in good battery life, but it may not be the 4 or so hours I get now.
Time machine seems useful, although I keep forgetting to eject the disk before
I unplug the backup drive &ndash; so I think I&rsquo;m going to end up getting the Time
Capsule before long, but I don&rsquo;t really want to spend that money right now.</p>

<p>The one thing that is slightly disappointing thus far is that the MacBook gets
a little choppy when playing World of Warcraft with everything maxed out. It&rsquo;s
not terrible and I do realize this machine has an integrated graphics card,
but WoW isn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> demanding&hellip;either way, it&rsquo;s still plenty playable, but
it&rsquo;s just a little disappointing that it&rsquo;s not as smooth as I&rsquo;d like.</p>

<p>After I&rsquo;ve used OS X for a few more weeks, I&rsquo;ll post my updated impressions,
but so far so good.</p>

			First DIY Oil Change Complete!</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today was the first time I have ever changed the oil in my Explorer at home
without help.  In the past, I always took it to Ford to have the service done
&ndash; but I don&rsquo;t like the Ford dealerships around here, so I wanted to do it
myself.  So last time I needed to change my oil, my Dad came up and helped me
change it.  His help was basically him doing the work, but me watching so I
had some idea of what was going on.  I&rsquo;ve been overdue for a change for a bit,
so I decided to bite the bullet and just go for it today.  It really isn&rsquo;t
that bad &ndash; I think the worst part of the whole thing is picking the proper oil
filter (there are tons of options out there).</p>

<p>The whole process of draining the oil is simple (just make sure you find the
correct drain plug&hellip;there may be more than just the oil one and if you pick
the wrong one&hellip;well&hellip;it probably wouldn&rsquo;t be very pretty).  All you really
do is remove the plug, let the oil drain, replace the plug, remove the filter,
let remaining oil drain (if any), install the new filter, then just fill it
back up with fresh oil.  It is a bit messy, but I would rather spend 30
minutes doing it myself than to spend 1-2 hours (mostly waiting) for someone
else to do it &ndash; and you can save quite a bit of money depending on how cheap
you want to be.  (I think my total costs are about the same as the dealer, but
they could be way less if I tried and didn&rsquo;t mind cheaper materials&hellip;)</p>

<p>Overall, the whole process is quite fun.  I think I&rsquo;m going to start learning
more about cars now &ndash; they don&rsquo;t seem that hard to understand&hellip;there are lots
of parts, but each part is pretty simple by itself.  We&rsquo;ll see how it goes,
but hopefully I&rsquo;ll learn enough that I can start to work on my car more to fix
the little issues that are popping up these days.</p>

			Startin the Blog Up Again&#8230;</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So, it&rsquo;s been nearly 2 months since I last blogged&hellip;  I&rsquo;ve had quite a few
things going on in those two months, probably as much or more than when I
first moved to TN.  I started remodeling my kitchen - the counter-tops will be
delivered on Friday if all goes as planned, then I&rsquo;ll get the sink in and
things will be all good.  I also changed jobs &ndash; I went from a relatively huge
public company with 55K-ish employees to a little bitty private software
company.  It&rsquo;s been quite a change, but it&rsquo;s great &ndash; it&rsquo;s exactly the type of
job I was looking for and I&rsquo;m enjoying the people there (although I do still
miss the people at the previous employer).  Overall though, it was the right
move and I have no regrets.  Anyway &ndash; I plan to start blogging a few times a
week at least from now on, but we&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>

			iPhone Thoughts - One Month Later</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve had my 4GB iPhone for about a month now so I thought I would share my
impressions now that I&rsquo;ve had plenty of time to check things out.  Overall,
I&rsquo;m still very happy with my purchase, but there are a few annoying things:</p>

<p><strong>No Tasklist.</strong>  I don&rsquo;t know why Apple decided to include all of the other PIM applications (contacts, calendar, notes), but decided to leave off a tasklist.  I really miss that feature from my Windows Mobile phone.  Hopefully Apple will add this soon.<br/>
<strong>Random Crashes.  </strong>It isn&rsquo;t clear why it happens, but every once in a while, the iPhone will freeze and I&rsquo;ll have to reboot.  Most of the time, I can just use the home button to kill the application and things are fine (although you usually lose whatever data you were updating, if any, when you do this).  It doesn&rsquo;t take long to reset (maybe 20 seconds), but it&rsquo;s still a bit of a pain.  My Windows Mobile phone and my PocketPC seem more stable (and I don&rsquo;t have non-Apple applications on my phone).<br/>
<strong>No local downloading.</strong>  You can browse anything you want via Safari, but you can&rsquo;t save anything.  I had one time when I really wanted to save a PDF document for viewing later or even e-mail it to myself&hellip;but the iPhone doesn&rsquo;t support that.<br/>
<strong>No copy &amp; paste.  </strong>There have been a couple of times when I needed to take a snippit of a webpage (or even copy a URL) and paste it into a note or e-mail, but at present, there is no ability to copy and paste on the iPhone.<br/>
Of coure, there are still the original issues of not having Flash support and
no Assisted GPS.</p>

<p>But other than these few issues, the phone really works well.  The photo
viewer works great, the call quality has been excellent, the EDGE network in
my area is certainly speedy enough for everything I&rsquo;ve needed, and the battery
life is better than I expected.  It may not be the perfect phone, but it&rsquo;s
certainly a step in the right direction.</p>

			Business 2.0 Is Dead</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&rsquo;ve been a loyal reader of Business 2.0 for quite a few years now.  It is one
of the only magazines to which I subscribe.  I really look forward to getting
it each month to see all of the new business ideas and to read the magazine&rsquo;s
take on various things.  Well, I just received my October copy and this is the
end of the road for Business 2.0.  Apparently they never figured out how to
get/keep advertisers interested in the magazine and it the magazine&rsquo;s parent
company decided it didn&rsquo;t bring in enough cash to trouble with keeping the
magazine alive.  Some of the staff are going to write for Fortune, but I just
don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be the same.  All of the other magazines are stuffed with
ads, so I may buy a 100 page magazine, but only 40 of the pages are actual
content&hellip;and I&rsquo;m not interested in flipping through ad after ad to find a
handful of stories that interest me &ndash; so I doubt I&rsquo;ll pick up a subscription
to anything else to replace Business 2.0.  Oh well, it was good while it
lasted.</p>
