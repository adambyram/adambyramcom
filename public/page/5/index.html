  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ran across an article the other day that I thought would be worth sharing -
it&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.raptitude.com/2009/07/88-important-truths-ive-learned-about-%0Alife/">&#8220;88 Important Truths I’ve Learned About
Life&#8221;</a>. I don&#8217;t necessarily think 100% of these items are &#8220;truths&#8221; in my life,
but I&#8217;d say I can certainly agree with the vast majority of them. You should
read the whole article - but here were my top favorites (with my thoughts in
italics):</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>You can’t change other people, and it’s rude to try.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p><em>I learned this one pretty early on - it has proven very true in my
experience. The key is that <em>you</em> can&#8217;t change other people, but they <em>can</em>
change&#8230;they just have to do the changing themselves.</em></p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>Every problem you have is your responsibility, regardless of who caused
it.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p><em>I like this one a lot because too many people have a victim mentality. In the
end though, your problems are just that&#8230;<em>your</em> problems. You don&#8217;t have to
solve them if you don&#8217;t want to, but don&#8217;t forget that they are yours to solve
and yours alone.</em></p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>Credit card debt devours souls.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Ok - this one is a little over the top for me, but I agree in general. Credit
card debt (or any kind of debt for that matter) will almost always detract
from you achieving your goals. If you manage it correctly, it may only have a
negligible impact on your life, but if you don&#8217;t, it can easily destroy it. So
while I wouldn&#8217;t go so far as credit card debt &#8220;devours souls&#8221;, I do believe
that having it will, at some point, have a net negative impact on your life.</em></p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>Most of what we see is only what we think about what we see.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Out of all 88 items in the article, this is my favorite. Essentially,
everything you see is based around perception which means you&#8217;ll color
everything you see with your own beliefs, assumptions, and knowledge.
Sometimes things will actually be what you perceived, but most than likely,
you only have a portion of the total picture.</em></p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>Even if it costs no money, nothing is free if it takes time.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p><em>I don&#8217;t have anything special to add to this one - but I totally
agree&#8230;<em>nothing</em> is truly free.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally finished the main story in Mass Effect just a couple of days ago. I
think I have about 15 hours of game time in&#8230;which is pretty short, but I
didn&#8217;t do all that many of the side missions. The story was really excellent.
There were quite a few surprises along the way that really made things move
along nicely.</p>

<p>I think Final Fantasy 7 is still the best RPG I&#8217;ve played, but I would say
Mass Effect is in my overall top 10 games list. The only thing that never
really clicked for me was all of the equipment. Sure, you can buy fancy
weapons and and all kinds of upgrades, but I barely did any of that and the
game wasn&#8217;t that hard to beat. I suppose I could up the difficulty level and
maybe all of the equipment would matter more.</p>

<p>In any event, it&#8217;s a fun game if you like more action oriented RPGs. Depending
on your choices, it may feel a little too much like a FPS for some people, but
the balance seemed just about right to me. Now I can start watching for Mass
Effect 2 information&#8230;I&#8217;ve been trying to avoid it until I finished this just
to make sure I didn&#8217;t see any of the ending before it was time.</p>

<time datetime="2009-07-01T00:01:50-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 1<span>st</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I thought it would be good to post an update on the ol&#8217; blog here and since
it&#8217;s the middle of the year, it seems fitting that the post should be an
update on my 2009 goals&#8230;.so here goes&#8230;</p>

<h4>Financial</h4>

<ul>
<li>Fully fund 2008 &amp; 2009 Roth IRAs <strong>[2008 fully funded; 2009 money saved, but not in Roth account yet] </strong></li>
<li>Pay off second mortgage OR refinance into single mortgage (with much lower rate and no PMI) <strong>[I&#8217;ve been thinking about this and I&#8217;m not sure I want to go ahead with this right now. The total cost to ReFi was higher than I expected for the great rates and the reality is that my second mortgage isn&#8217;t hurting that much.  Given certain things going on in my career right now, holding on to the money seems like a wise thing to do for the moment. At present, about 1/2 of this is already in savings.] </strong></li>
<li>Get my side income up to the point I could live off of it if the need arose (NOT trying to get this to replace my actual income level…although that would be fantastic if it did) <strong>[This is about the same or lower than it was at the start of the year - I&#8217;m still trying to hit this goal though.] </strong></li>
<li>Maintain at least a 3 month emergency fund (currently at 12 months, but expect some of this to use used for other financial goals) <strong>[I&#8217;ve got around 6-8 months still hanging around at the moment, so even if I reallocate some of this for the mortgage payoff or towards investments, I&#8217;ll still be able to reach this goal just fine.]</strong></li>
</ul>


<h4>Health</h4>

<ul>
<li>Get weight to 190 or lower and keep it there (~25 lbs to lose) <strong>[Yeah&#8230;still um, working on this one.  Good news is I didn&#8217;t gain much weight&#8230;but I also didn&#8217;t exactly lose any either.  This one is still doable though&#8230;]</strong></li>
<li>Decrease caffeine intake - and keep it down (target is around 1 12oz can of soda per day or less) <strong>[I did this one for a couple of months and now I&#8217;m back to drinking more soda than I should be.  I&#8217;ve done a decent job of keeping it out of the fridge at home, but at work, that&#8217;s a different story.  Going to refocus on this one.]</strong></li>
<li>Drink more water (no particular amount - just when I’m thirsty, grab a water instead of a soda) <strong>[I&#8217;ve been drinking a moderate amount of water, but I&#8217;m still prone to grab a soda&#8230;so I need to focus more on this one as well.  It&#8217;s perfectly doable, but still on the ToDo list.]</strong></li>
<li>Cook (healthly-ish) meals at home more than I eat out (including lunch) <strong>[Um, yeah&#8230;.gotta get the ball rolling on this one too.  The biggest problem here is going to lunch with the guys at work.  I have to stop that - it&#8217;ll help save a bit of money and be a bit healthier.]</strong></li>
</ul>


<h4>Personal &amp; Professional Development / Other</h4>

<ul>
<li>Read at least 1 non-fiction (but not computer related) book a month <strong>[I&#8217;m going to miss this goal - with everything else going on, I just can&#8217;t do this.  I do have a couple of new books to read - but not 12.]</strong></li>
<li>Read at least 1 fiction book a month <strong>[Same as the non-fiction goal&#8230;I&#8217;d like to read a couple, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll get more than that in this year.] </strong></li>
<li>Attend WWDC 2009 (contingent on other financial goals being met/on track in May) <strong>[This one is completed.  I went to WWDC a few weeks ago&#8230;that reminds me, I need to blog about that&#8230;]</strong></li>
<li>Get my passport <strong>[Still need to do this one&#8230;I&#8217;m not in a rush for it though, I&#8217;d just like to get it done so I have it for the future.] </strong></li>
<li>Write at least one blog post per week on this blog - just to start writing more <strong>[If you&#8217;ve checked this blog much you know I haven&#8217;t been anywhere close to successful on this one.  I need to make time for this, just for my own sake, but I&#8217;m not sure if I can do that.  I&#8217;ll probably put a preference to posting on my business blog over this one and still only post on this one when I have something in general that I want to share.]</strong>
So how do I feel about my progress?  Financially, I feel really good.  While
all of the goals aren&#8217;t completed just yet, I&#8217;m nearly there number wise&#8230;and
that&#8217;s after taking into account the WWDC trip and a trip to Las Vegas.
Health wise, I really dropped the ball.  I got distracted with too many other
things and this set of goals really suffered.  I&#8217;m slightly disappointed with
my progress on the personal/professional goals, but at the same time, I&#8217;ve had
a heck of a lot happen and learned a lot over the last 6 months. While I may
not have accomplished the specific goals I outlined at the beginning of the
year, I think I&#8217;ve still grown quite a lot in this area so at least progress
is being made.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This weekend, I&#8217;ve started the process of moving away from Dreamhost and onto
Linode. I&#8217;ll post about why I decided to move later, but in if things look odd
around the blog for the next day or so, it&#8217;s probably related to the move (I&#8217;m
having to reconfigure all kinds of things).</p>
