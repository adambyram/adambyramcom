  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>1) Cut the cable</strong><br/>
Do you really need those 100 channels you never watch?  I have an HDTV that
picks up over the air channels and I can assure you that my FOX, NBC, ABC, and
PBS look just as good, if not better, than anything you would get on cable.
It does mean giving up certain channels (I do miss Sci-Fi, Discovery, and a
couple of other ones), but it saves a ton of money and you don&#8217;t have to deal
with the cable company.</p>

<p><strong>2) Check the unit price on grocery items</strong><br/>
I find it amazing that identical items in the grocery have vastly different
pricing.  Two different brands of the same pasta sauce may have the same price
per item, but if you look at the unit price, you may see that one of them
actually gives you quite a bit more sauce for the same price (you can&#8217;t always
tell this by the size of the container).  Another really surprising thing is
that larger &#8220;family size&#8221; items are often more per unit than the &#8220;regular&#8221;
size item - sounds strange, but if you check out the unit price on the labels,
you&#8217;ll see what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>

<p><strong>3) Use fans instead of air conditioner when possible</strong><br/>
This certainly depends on where you live, but around here, it&#8217;s quite hot in
the summer.  If I know I&#8217;m only going to be in a couple of rooms in the house,
I&#8217;ll just open a window or use a fan since there is no point to chilling the
whole house.</p>

<p><strong>4) Never buy on credit (specifically don&#8217;t pay interest)</strong><br/>
Hopefully it&#8217;s obvious that it&#8217;s always worse to end up paying more for an
item than what the store charged&#8230;if not, these tips probably won&#8217;t help&#8230;
The best thing you can do for yourself is to stop using credit cards - go with
your bank check card.</p>

<p><strong>5) Minimize impulse buying (still working on this one - but it usually works well with #7)</strong><br/>
This is one of the hardest things for me to do - you see the new gadget come
out, want the extra pack of candy in the grocery that you didn&#8217;t plan on,
decide it&#8217;s time to buy an HDTV&#8230;  The best way I&#8217;ve found to minimize this
is to keep very little money in my checking account - I move it all to
investments (either mutual funds or savings accounts like ING Direct).  That
way, I can get the money if I need it, but I don&#8217;t have enough to make a huge
purchase unless I go through a transfer process that takes 3-5 days&#8230;by then,
I may decide I didn&#8217;t really need the item anyway.</p>

<p><strong>6) Know where your money is going / Implement a budget</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s really important that you know where your money is going - I don&#8217;t
particularly like doing a true budget, so I track all expenses (including
categories) in Quicken, then review spending each month to see how I&#8217;m doing
against my mental budget.  Doing a &#8220;real&#8221; budget would be more helpful, but I
haven&#8217;t found a nice way to do the budget the way I want in Quicken.</p>

<p><strong>7) Treat yourself to something nice</strong><br/>
When I first decided I would start cutting my expenses and saving up to pay
off my student loans early, I kept myself from buying anything unless I really
needed it.  The problem I ran into was that sometimes it would feel even worse
than being broke - sometimes you just need to have a little something extra.
I&#8217;m taking buying a $50 video game or $100 night out - not buying a car or
something crazy like that.  If you don&#8217;t treat yourself, what will probably
happen is that you&#8217;ll eventually break down and spend like crazy for a bit and
it&#8217;ll put you back to square one - sounds crazy I know, but trust me, it&#8217;s
better to set aside $100/mo blow money instead of spending $3000 one month
because you couldn&#8217;t take it anymore.</p>

<p><strong>8) Use utilities efficiently</strong><br/>
Nothing special here - use compact florescent light bulbs, turn off the lights
when you&#8217;re not in the room, minimize hot water usage, don&#8217;t water the lawn if
you don&#8217;t have to, etc.  Turning off the computer at night can save about
$20/mo - you&#8217;ll be surprised at home much it costs to use different items you
have around the house.</p>

<p><strong>9) Be as frugal as possible, but not cheap (buy good quality / be proactive)</strong><br/>
I&#8217;ll explain this one via an example - 6 months ago, I bought a little
battery-powered drill for $30.  I used it to drive in some screws here and
there and it worked fine.  I recently decided to put in new cabinets and
needed to do more heavy duty work.  Well, the drill basically bit the dust -
it couldn&#8217;t take the stress.  So now I need a new drill&#8230; If I would have
went ahead and bought a good quality drill from the start for $100 or so, I
would have come out much better than having to go buy a new one now (plus the
time lost messing with the cheap drill trying to finish the job).  These days,
I try to buy the middle priced version of whatever I&#8217;m buying - I don&#8217;t care
for paying premium prices, but I don&#8217;t mind paying a few dollars more when
those few dollars create enough value to justify the extra expense.</p>

<p><strong>10) Avoid marketing as much as possible</strong><br/>
This sounds dumb, but the more marketing you&#8217;re exposed to, the more stuff
you&#8217;ll want to buy - that&#8217;s the point of marketing after all.  Now that
doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;ll buy something just because you saw a single ad, but
it does mean that the more ads you see, the harder #5 gets.  I know I&#8217;m going
to have to stay away from Apple keynotes - I don&#8217;t know why, but they always
make me want to buy the newest thing Apple thought up&#8230;so far, I&#8217;ve been able
to resist, but it&#8217;d be even better if I would just stop watching&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A quick FYI on Amazon&#8217;s Unbox service.  I had 7 rentals on my computer that I
had not been able to watch yet, but I needed to downgrade my Vista install to
32-bit (from the 64-bit version).  So I copied off the Amazon videos and
uninstalled the Unbox software.  Then after the new version of Vista was
installed, I tried to re-import the videos into Unbox (they provide an Import
function).  What I didn&#8217;t realize is that the Unbox agreement says you can&#8217;t
move rental videos from your original download location&#8230;  I&#8217;m not sure if
Amazon Customer Service is going to help here or not, but I think they will
this one time.  Something to keep in mind if you&#8217;re thinking about getting a
video rental.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When the iPhone first launched, I <a href="http://www.adambyram.com/2007/06/24/3-reasons-i-probably-%0Awont-buy-an-iphone/">posted about three reasons I would NOT be
buying an iPhone</a>&#8230;yesterday, I broke down and bought a 4GB iPhone.  So
what changed?</p>

<p>1) Price</p>

<p>I have a 5th generation iPod - so I don&#8217;t need an 8/16GB+ player - so 4GB is
just fine with me.  Apple decided to discontinue the 4GB model, so the price
dropped to $299 from $499.  If you look at other smartphones out there, $300
isn&#8217;t a bad price at all.</p>

<p>2) Seeing is Believing (i.e. why the on-screen keyboard works)</p>

<p>One of my original concerns was the fact that the keyboard has no feedback at
all.  After playing with the phone for a bit, it&#8217;s pretty obvious the keyboard
is just fine.  There is a large keyboard for use with Safari for web browsing
and that keyboard is great.  Then there is a small keyboard for SMS, e-mail,
etc.  The small keyboard is usable, but it isn&#8217;t quite as good.  But when I
thought about it, even the small keyboard is vastly superior to the other non-
querty keyboards and it&#8217;s really not much worse than the hardware qwerty
keyboards I&#8217;ve used on a Treo.</p>

<p>3) Did I really need GPS? No.</p>

<p>I originally thought I really needed GPS in the phone - and I admit, I think
it would still be a great feature with the built-in Google Maps.  But after
thinking about this for a while, I came to the conclusion that I would most
likely use the maps to figure out what streets to take, finding where to
connect to the interstate, etc and really didn&#8217;t need my position or real-time
navigation.  I also have a Garmin GPS unit for times when I really do want a
true GPS and I have a feeling it would work much better than anything they can
cram into a cellphone anyway.</p>

<p>The one thing I&#8217;m still worried about from my original post is 3rd party
application support.  The included applications are decent overall and I can
certainly get the job done, but it would be nice to have the option to extend
the functionality easily (e.g. adding a Pocket Quicken application).  I know
it&#8217;s possible to do a hack on the phone to make this work (or was possible at
one point), but this is still something Apple needs to address.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I noticed Amazon had a $0.99 sale on a couple of new movies I had been wanting
to see (Ghost Rider, 300, Shooter) so I decided to give it a try - after all,
no shipping, no tax, means you can&#8217;t beat the price.  My setup is Windows
Vista Ultimate 64-bit and an Xbox 360 with wireless adapter (I stream the
movies to the HDTV via the 360).  My initial impressions:</p>

<p><strong>The Good</strong><br/>
Install and movie purchase was quick and simple overall (however, it is a tiny
bit less simple for 64-bit users&#8230;more on that later).  It was dead simple to
stream to the 360 - if you already have the media center connection setup,
then you&#8217;re ready to go.  The quality is on par with DVD - it&#8217;s certainly not
HD, but I was watching on a 56&#8221; HDTV and it looked as good as any DVD I have.</p>

<p><strong>The Bad</strong><br/>
When I first installed the software, I got a message saying something was
wrong with my computer&#8217;s DRM configuration.  My only guess is that it has
something to do with being on a 64-bit - but I really don&#8217;t know.  The Unbox
software offers to help troubleshoot - so I did that and it found a patch to
automatically install&#8230;after that, everything went fine.  The download speed
is a bit slow - I rented 5 movies the first night (you can keep them for 30
days) at around 10pm.  By 8am or so the next morning, 4 of the 5 movies were
downloaded.  The files are between 1.5GB - 3GB - so it&#8217;s certainly going to
take a while to download them, but the speed could be just a tad better&#8230;but
it&#8217;s not a huge issue - just realize that you&#8217;ll need to wait about an hour or
so after you rent the movie before you can start playing it.  The biggest
issue I have with Amazon&#8217;s Unbox service is the lack of 5.1 channel audio -
the audio quality is decent, but it&#8217;s certainly not on the same level as a DVD
and there is no true surround sound.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s no question that Unbox is a great deal if you find a movie you&#8217;d like
to see for $0.99 - it&#8217;s the way to go at that price.  I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll be
using it for full price rentals though ($3.99) - for that price, I can get
NetFlix or Blockbuster Online (and better sound quality).  If Amazon can drop
the price to $1.99 for a one day rental, I&#8217;d be doing a lot more Unboxing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the things that has been hugely frustrating about my move to Vista is
that the backup tool is &#8220;dumbed down&#8221;.  It only copies files it wants to copy
and it requires that you backup C: whether you want to or not.  All I wanted
to do was schedule a daily backup from my data drive D: to my archive drive V:
- I want any type of file copied&#8230;just a basic mirror type copy.  Apparently
this is impossible in the standard windows backup application.  Enter Robocopy
- a small command-line utility from Microsoft (included in Vista) that does
exactly this.  Robocopy can take a source and destination and perform a mirror
copy without a problem - and since it&#8217;s a command-line application, you can
schedule it to run whenever you&#8217;d like.  It has tons of options to exclude
certain files/directories based on name, attribute, date, etc - but the basic
command to do a mirror copy is just this:</p>

<p><code>robocopy d:\ v:\ /MIR</code></p>

<p>Nifty huh?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw a link to a &#8220;nerd test&#8221; while reading over the old RSS feeds from some
fellow Knoxville bloggers (<a href="http://www.vinull.com/Blogs/Default.aspx">Mike </a>&amp;
<a href="http://www.dylanwolf.com/">Dylan</a>) and I had to take it.  Apparently, I&#8217;m a
Nerd God - but I&#8217;m not sure why&#8230;my answers weren&#8217;t really that &#8220;out there&#8221;
for most of the questions&#8230;  Of course, the fact that I don&#8217;t see anything
&#8220;wrong&#8221; with my answers is probably part of the issue&#8230;or maybe I&#8217;m just that
l33t.</p>

<p>My score on <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/tests/9935030990046738815/Nerd-Geek-or-%0ADork-">The Nerd? Geek? or Dork?

<p>For The Record:</p>

<p>A Nerd is someone who is passionate about learning/being smart/academia. A
Geek is someone who is passionate about some particular area or subject, often
an obscure or difficult one. A Dork is someone who has difficulty with common

<p>You scored better than half in Nerd and Geek, earning you the title of:
Modern, Cool Nerd.</p>

<p>Nerds didn&#8217;t use to be cool, but in the 90&#8217;s that all changed. It used to be
that, if you were a computer expert, you had to wear plaid or a pocket
protector or suspenders or something that announced to the world that you
couldn&#8217;t quite fit in. Not anymore. Now, the intelligent and geeky have eked
out for themselves a modicum of respect at the very least, and &#8220;geek is chic.&#8221;
The Modern, Cool Nerd is intelligent, knowledgable and always the person to

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I set a goal for myself at the beginning of 2007 - that goal was to be debt
free except the house by the end of the year.  (Yeah - I drank the <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com">Dave
Ramsey kool-aid</a>&#8230;well, mostly at least&#8230;)  After
the first few months, I figured out how to trim my expenses even more and
figured out that I could actually pay off my student loans by my birthday (end
of September).  At the end of 2006, I paid off all credit cards and any other
foolishness I had - so I only have 3 &#8220;debt&#8221; items laying around these days:
student loans (~$15K total), 1st mortgage, and 2nd mortgage.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m on track to pay off my student loans by the end of September, but it&#8217;s
really tempting to pay off the 2nd mortgage first.  Both are about the same
amount (second mortgage is a few thousand higher, but that just means waiting
a month or so to pay it off if I chose that route), but the interest rate on
my student loan is 4.25% while the second mortgage is at 8.25%.  Because of
that (and the terms around each loan), my student loan payment is $125 a month
and my 2nd mortgage is $190&#8230;so paying it off first would free up $190
instead of only $125.</p>

<p>But here&#8217;s the catch (and the reason I&#8217;ll probably still pay off the student
loans first) - in a worst case scenario, I could probably sell the house and
at least break even (if not, I wouldn&#8217;t owe much).  In that case, both
mortgages would be taken care of, but the student loan will still be there.
No matter what happens (practically&#8230;there are a few legal things that I&#8217;m
going to ignore), I&#8217;m stuck with the student loan for up to 14 more years (the
remaining length of the loan).  It seems really risky to me to pay off the
second mortgage before the student loans.</p>

<p>Realistically, my plan would be to pay off the student loans first (just to
have them out of the way), buy some new camera equipment (as a celebration
type thing&#8230;and because I &#8220;need&#8221; it&#8230;), fill up the 5K for Roth IRA 2008,
then focus on knocking out my 2nd mortgage as quickly as possible.  If raises
go as usual next year at work, I can probably expect I would have the income
to do all of the above between now and Jan 1 2009.  It&#8217;s just a question of
what else will happen between now and then.</p>

<p>Anyway - I&#8217;m 80% sure I&#8217;m going to go ahead and pay off the student loans as
planned, but it&#8217;s still a hard choice because of the interest rates (and the
fact that I could invest it and do decently as well).  But when it comes down
to it, I&#8217;ve really liked not having credit card payments and it feels great
not to be paying on my everyday items anymore.  I can only imagine what it
will feel like to have the house paid off one day&#8230;  The really amazing thing
is that it&#8217;s not <em>that</em> hard - oh, it&#8217;s hard, but not <em>that</em> hard.  At the
very least, it&#8217;s been interesting having to make all these choices now that I
have a &#8220;real world&#8221; income.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I&#8217;ve had a copy of Windows XP Professional x64 for quite a while - I never
bothered to install it because all of my machines, except one, are 32-bit
only.  My main desktop has an older Athlon 64 (3500+) processor, but I
recently bumped up the RAM to 3GB for some photography and development work -
so I decided it was time to give the 64-bit world a try.  I&#8217;m not sure why
exactly, but after about 2 weeks of running x64, my machine is still blazing
fast.  With XP Pro 32-bit, my machine was really taking a while to startup and
would get bogged down quite easily.  I&#8217;m sure I have less software installed
on the machine now, but I have my main applications installed now and things
are quite nice.</p>

<p>I was a bit worried that some of my hardware wouldn&#8217;t be supported under a
64-bit Windows OS (which is one reason I haven&#8217;t been in a hurry to jump on
the Vista bandwagon&#8230;I know there is 32-bit Vista, but if I have a 64-bit
machine, I&#8217;m running a 64-bit OS&#8230;).  Anyway - the experience of getting
things up and running was really quite nice.  Some applications went and
installed just fine without any modification at all.  Others did require that
I download a 64-bit version of the installer (as the 32-bit installer refused
to run at all), but this was pretty painless.  Even my Brother multi-function
laser printer and my Garmin Legend C GPS device had 64-bit compatible drivers,
which was pretty surprising.  Interestingly enough, the only application I&#8217;ve
really had trouble with is Apple&#8217;s iTunes.  I have the latest version of the
software and the install process went fine, but when it came time to sync my
iPod, I got all sorts of errors.  I ended up &#8220;restoring&#8221; (i.e. reformatting
basically) my iPod 3 times, disabling all syncing except music, and rebooting
a few times&#8230;now things &#8220;work&#8221;.  I still get funky error messages every once
in a while, but my music plays on the PC and my iPod appears to have my music
again.  I noticed that Apple has a page saying 64-bit Windows (XP Pro and
Vista) aren&#8217;t actually supported by iTunes at this time - which is kinda funny
because now I&#8217;m seeing quite a few posts from <strike>iBroke</strike> iPhone
owners that are upset that they can&#8217;t sync the iPhone since they run 64-bit
OSes.</p>

<p>Anyway, I thought I would post my base application list in case anyone else is
curious about what works in the 64-bit world:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adobe Photoshop CS2</li>
<li>Adobe Photoshop Lightroom v1.1</li>
<li>Microsoft Office 2003</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2005</li>
<li>Microsoft Virtual PC 2007 (* 64-bit installer required)</li>
<li>Garmin City Navigator v7 (* after 64-bit driver download for GPS unit)</li>
<li>Quicken 2006 Home and Business</li>
<li>Microsoft ActiveSync</li>
<li>Apple Safari (Beta 3)</li>
<li>Alcohol 52%</li>
<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m really wanting a new phone - my current one (SMT 5600) has been through a
lot and it&#8217;s about time to upgrade.   One of the phones I&#8217;ve been considering
is Apple&#8217;s new iPhone.  After doing quite a bit of research on the web, I
don&#8217;t believe the iPhone is going to be my next phone for a few reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>No integrated GPS </strong>If I&#8217;m going to pay $500+ for a new phone that has really nice mapping software like the iPhone, it&#8217;s sure as heck going to have GPS support.  Sure, the iPhone may eventually support assisted GPS (where it uses the cell towers to determine the location) and that may work out well, but for now, it doesn&#8217;t look like any form of GPS will be supported in the near future.</li>
<li><strong>No tactile QWERTY keyboard </strong>I type at a decent speed on a regular keyboard and I know that speed will be drastically reduced on a mobile device, but I just can&#8217;t imagine how the virtual keyboard will work on the iPhone.  Apple says it takes a week or so to get the hang of it and then you&#8217;ll be typing at a productive speed, but I&#8217;m not so sure.  I type fast by not looking at the keys and can &#8220;feel&#8221; when I hit the wrong key and I don&#8217;t think that will translate well to the iPhone.  I have no doubt that the virtual keyboard will be really nice compared to using the standard phone keypad for text entry, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll be quite as good as a Treo/Blackberry type keyboard.  Maybe I&#8217;m under-estimating Apple here, but from the blogs I&#8217;ve seen where people tried to use the iPhone, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m too far off.  I&#8217;m sure this won&#8217;t be a huge issue for people that just want to send quick text messages, but if you&#8217;re like me and want the ability to respond to e-mails or post to a blog etc., then this may be an issue.</li>
<li><strong>Closed API and no SDK </strong>I realize most people don&#8217;t care about this at all, but as a software developer, I see this is quite a big issue.  Apple has said that third-party applications will be allowed on the phone as widgets (meaning HTML/JavaScript code that runs inside of Safari in the case of the iPhone).  It&#8217;s possible that Apple will expose key parts of the iPhone&#8217;s OS through javascript, but I haven&#8217;t heard anyone mention it yet.  To me, this means that you&#8217;ll have a powerful UNIX-based phone that really doesn&#8217;t do anything more than show pretty web widgets unless Apple decides to create more &#8220;real&#8221; applications for the phone.  Just seems like a waste of hardware too have so much potential trapped inside there with no way to access it - but maybe the widget interface will turn out better than anyone can imagine.</li>
</ol>
