  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had my 4GB iPhone for about a month now so I thought I would share my
impressions now that I&#8217;ve had plenty of time to check things out.  Overall,
I&#8217;m still very happy with my purchase, but there are a few annoying things:</p>

<p><strong>No Tasklist.</strong>  I don&#8217;t know why Apple decided to include all of the other PIM applications (contacts, calendar, notes), but decided to leave off a tasklist.  I really miss that feature from my Windows Mobile phone.  Hopefully Apple will add this soon.<br/>
<strong>Random Crashes.  </strong>It isn&#8217;t clear why it happens, but every once in a while, the iPhone will freeze and I&#8217;ll have to reboot.  Most of the time, I can just use the home button to kill the application and things are fine (although you usually lose whatever data you were updating, if any, when you do this).  It doesn&#8217;t take long to reset (maybe 20 seconds), but it&#8217;s still a bit of a pain.  My Windows Mobile phone and my PocketPC seem more stable (and I don&#8217;t have non-Apple applications on my phone).<br/>
<strong>No local downloading.</strong>  You can browse anything you want via Safari, but you can&#8217;t save anything.  I had one time when I really wanted to save a PDF document for viewing later or even e-mail it to myself&#8230;but the iPhone doesn&#8217;t support that.<br/>
<strong>No copy &amp; paste.  </strong>There have been a couple of times when I needed to take a snippit of a webpage (or even copy a URL) and paste it into a note or e-mail, but at present, there is no ability to copy and paste on the iPhone.<br/>
Of coure, there are still the original issues of not having Flash support and
no Assisted GPS.</p>

<p>But other than these few issues, the phone really works well.  The photo
viewer works great, the call quality has been excellent, the EDGE network in
my area is certainly speedy enough for everything I&#8217;ve needed, and the battery
life is better than I expected.  It may not be the perfect phone, but it&#8217;s
certainly a step in the right direction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a loyal reader of Business 2.0 for quite a few years now.  It is one
of the only magazines to which I subscribe.  I really look forward to getting
it each month to see all of the new business ideas and to read the magazine&#8217;s
take on various things.  Well, I just received my October copy and this is the
end of the road for Business 2.0.  Apparently they never figured out how to
get/keep advertisers interested in the magazine and it the magazine&#8217;s parent
company decided it didn&#8217;t bring in enough cash to trouble with keeping the
magazine alive.  Some of the staff are going to write for Fortune, but I just
don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll be the same.  All of the other magazines are stuffed with
ads, so I may buy a 100 page magazine, but only 40 of the pages are actual
content&#8230;and I&#8217;m not interested in flipping through ad after ad to find a
handful of stories that interest me - so I doubt I&#8217;ll pick up a subscription
to anything else to replace Business 2.0.  Oh well, it was good while it
lasted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while back, I posted that I made the move to 64-bit Vista.  Then I got an
iPhone, which doesn&#8217;t have 64-bit drivers, so I downgraded to Vista 32-bit.
Well, this weekend, I have had another ordeal - I just finished installing
32-bit Vista again.  My primary hard drive is beginning to fail apparently -
it did have a handful of bad sectors.  I&#8217;m fine with that, except Vista
refused to boot up so I can do a couple of things like de-activate iTunes,
check for any files that I may need to save (mainly installers - I keep all
data on a different drive), etc.  Well - after trying to boot into Vista in
every way I could think of, I decided I&#8217;ll go ahead and reinstall.  Guess what
- the install DVD fails to startup as well!  It would try to startup, but then
it would hang at the loading screen (black screen with the little green
progress bar at the bottom).  It appears that Vista&#8217;s boot process (from DVD
or HDD) can be hung when there is a corrupted partion.  I can understand the
HDD install not booting, but come on - why can&#8217;t the DVD boot?</p>

<p>I ended up getting an iso of the <a href="http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/">Ultimate Boot
CD</a>, running SeaTools to fix up the drive, and
then using the disk partioning tools there to wipe the drive clean.  After
that, the Vista DVD was able to boot just fine and now I&#8217;m finally back up and
running.  This is one of the reasons I keep wanting to switch to Apple though
- I know they have issues as well, but I can&#8217;t believe the various issues I
keep hitting with Vista&#8230;granted, I&#8217;m a power user so I don&#8217;t expect most of
the issues I see would cause a problem with &#8220;normal&#8221; home users, but geez,
it&#8217;s bad when I&#8217;m tempted to downgrade back to XP at least once a week.</p>

<time datetime="2007-09-10T01:23:33-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 10<span>th</span>, 2007</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>1) Cut the cable</strong><br/>
Do you really need those 100 channels you never watch?  I have an HDTV that
picks up over the air channels and I can assure you that my FOX, NBC, ABC, and
PBS look just as good, if not better, than anything you would get on cable.
It does mean giving up certain channels (I do miss Sci-Fi, Discovery, and a
couple of other ones), but it saves a ton of money and you don&#8217;t have to deal
with the cable company.</p>

<p><strong>2) Check the unit price on grocery items</strong><br/>
I find it amazing that identical items in the grocery have vastly different
pricing.  Two different brands of the same pasta sauce may have the same price
per item, but if you look at the unit price, you may see that one of them
actually gives you quite a bit more sauce for the same price (you can&#8217;t always
tell this by the size of the container).  Another really surprising thing is
that larger &#8220;family size&#8221; items are often more per unit than the &#8220;regular&#8221;
size item - sounds strange, but if you check out the unit price on the labels,
you&#8217;ll see what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>

<p><strong>3) Use fans instead of air conditioner when possible</strong><br/>
This certainly depends on where you live, but around here, it&#8217;s quite hot in
the summer.  If I know I&#8217;m only going to be in a couple of rooms in the house,
I&#8217;ll just open a window or use a fan since there is no point to chilling the
whole house.</p>

<p><strong>4) Never buy on credit (specifically don&#8217;t pay interest)</strong><br/>
Hopefully it&#8217;s obvious that it&#8217;s always worse to end up paying more for an
item than what the store charged&#8230;if not, these tips probably won&#8217;t help&#8230;
The best thing you can do for yourself is to stop using credit cards - go with
your bank check card.</p>

<p><strong>5) Minimize impulse buying (still working on this one - but it usually works well with #7)</strong><br/>
This is one of the hardest things for me to do - you see the new gadget come
out, want the extra pack of candy in the grocery that you didn&#8217;t plan on,
decide it&#8217;s time to buy an HDTV&#8230;  The best way I&#8217;ve found to minimize this
is to keep very little money in my checking account - I move it all to
investments (either mutual funds or savings accounts like ING Direct).  That
way, I can get the money if I need it, but I don&#8217;t have enough to make a huge
purchase unless I go through a transfer process that takes 3-5 days&#8230;by then,
I may decide I didn&#8217;t really need the item anyway.</p>

<p><strong>6) Know where your money is going / Implement a budget</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s really important that you know where your money is going - I don&#8217;t
particularly like doing a true budget, so I track all expenses (including
categories) in Quicken, then review spending each month to see how I&#8217;m doing
against my mental budget.  Doing a &#8220;real&#8221; budget would be more helpful, but I
haven&#8217;t found a nice way to do the budget the way I want in Quicken.</p>

<p><strong>7) Treat yourself to something nice</strong><br/>
When I first decided I would start cutting my expenses and saving up to pay
off my student loans early, I kept myself from buying anything unless I really
needed it.  The problem I ran into was that sometimes it would feel even worse
than being broke - sometimes you just need to have a little something extra.
I&#8217;m taking buying a $50 video game or $100 night out - not buying a car or
something crazy like that.  If you don&#8217;t treat yourself, what will probably
happen is that you&#8217;ll eventually break down and spend like crazy for a bit and
it&#8217;ll put you back to square one - sounds crazy I know, but trust me, it&#8217;s
better to set aside $100/mo blow money instead of spending $3000 one month
because you couldn&#8217;t take it anymore.</p>

<p><strong>8) Use utilities efficiently</strong><br/>
Nothing special here - use compact florescent light bulbs, turn off the lights
when you&#8217;re not in the room, minimize hot water usage, don&#8217;t water the lawn if
you don&#8217;t have to, etc.  Turning off the computer at night can save about
$20/mo - you&#8217;ll be surprised at home much it costs to use different items you
have around the house.</p>

<p><strong>9) Be as frugal as possible, but not cheap (buy good quality / be proactive)</strong><br/>
I&#8217;ll explain this one via an example - 6 months ago, I bought a little
battery-powered drill for $30.  I used it to drive in some screws here and
there and it worked fine.  I recently decided to put in new cabinets and
needed to do more heavy duty work.  Well, the drill basically bit the dust -
it couldn&#8217;t take the stress.  So now I need a new drill&#8230; If I would have
went ahead and bought a good quality drill from the start for $100 or so, I
would have come out much better than having to go buy a new one now (plus the
time lost messing with the cheap drill trying to finish the job).  These days,
I try to buy the middle priced version of whatever I&#8217;m buying - I don&#8217;t care
for paying premium prices, but I don&#8217;t mind paying a few dollars more when
those few dollars create enough value to justify the extra expense.</p>

<p><strong>10) Avoid marketing as much as possible</strong><br/>
This sounds dumb, but the more marketing you&#8217;re exposed to, the more stuff
you&#8217;ll want to buy - that&#8217;s the point of marketing after all.  Now that
doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;ll buy something just because you saw a single ad, but
it does mean that the more ads you see, the harder #5 gets.  I know I&#8217;m going
to have to stay away from Apple keynotes - I don&#8217;t know why, but they always
make me want to buy the newest thing Apple thought up&#8230;so far, I&#8217;ve been able
to resist, but it&#8217;d be even better if I would just stop watching&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A quick FYI on Amazon&#8217;s Unbox service.  I had 7 rentals on my computer that I
had not been able to watch yet, but I needed to downgrade my Vista install to
32-bit (from the 64-bit version).  So I copied off the Amazon videos and
uninstalled the Unbox software.  Then after the new version of Vista was
installed, I tried to re-import the videos into Unbox (they provide an Import
function).  What I didn&#8217;t realize is that the Unbox agreement says you can&#8217;t
move rental videos from your original download location&#8230;  I&#8217;m not sure if
Amazon Customer Service is going to help here or not, but I think they will
this one time.  Something to keep in mind if you&#8217;re thinking about getting a
video rental.</p>

<time datetime="2007-09-09T12:27:51-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 9<span>th</span>, 2007</time>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>When the iPhone first launched, I <a href="http://www.adambyram.com/2007/06/24/3-reasons-i-probably-%0Awont-buy-an-iphone/">posted about three reasons I would NOT be
buying an iPhone</a>&#8230;yesterday, I broke down and bought a 4GB iPhone.  So
what changed?</p>

<p>1) Price</p>

<p>I have a 5th generation iPod - so I don&#8217;t need an 8/16GB+ player - so 4GB is
just fine with me.  Apple decided to discontinue the 4GB model, so the price
dropped to $299 from $499.  If you look at other smartphones out there, $300
isn&#8217;t a bad price at all.</p>

<p>2) Seeing is Believing (i.e. why the on-screen keyboard works)</p>

<p>One of my original concerns was the fact that the keyboard has no feedback at
all.  After playing with the phone for a bit, it&#8217;s pretty obvious the keyboard
is just fine.  There is a large keyboard for use with Safari for web browsing
and that keyboard is great.  Then there is a small keyboard for SMS, e-mail,
etc.  The small keyboard is usable, but it isn&#8217;t quite as good.  But when I
thought about it, even the small keyboard is vastly superior to the other non-
querty keyboards and it&#8217;s really not much worse than the hardware qwerty
keyboards I&#8217;ve used on a Treo.</p>

<p>3) Did I really need GPS? No.</p>

<p>I originally thought I really needed GPS in the phone - and I admit, I think
it would still be a great feature with the built-in Google Maps.  But after
thinking about this for a while, I came to the conclusion that I would most
likely use the maps to figure out what streets to take, finding where to
connect to the interstate, etc and really didn&#8217;t need my position or real-time
navigation.  I also have a Garmin GPS unit for times when I really do want a
true GPS and I have a feeling it would work much better than anything they can
cram into a cellphone anyway.</p>

<p>The one thing I&#8217;m still worried about from my original post is 3rd party
application support.  The included applications are decent overall and I can
certainly get the job done, but it would be nice to have the option to extend
the functionality easily (e.g. adding a Pocket Quicken application).  I know
it&#8217;s possible to do a hack on the phone to make this work (or was possible at
one point), but this is still something Apple needs to address.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I noticed Amazon had a $0.99 sale on a couple of new movies I had been wanting
to see (Ghost Rider, 300, Shooter) so I decided to give it a try - after all,
no shipping, no tax, means you can&#8217;t beat the price.  My setup is Windows
Vista Ultimate 64-bit and an Xbox 360 with wireless adapter (I stream the
movies to the HDTV via the 360).  My initial impressions:</p>

<p><strong>The Good</strong><br/>
Install and movie purchase was quick and simple overall (however, it is a tiny
bit less simple for 64-bit users&#8230;more on that later).  It was dead simple to
stream to the 360 - if you already have the media center connection setup,
then you&#8217;re ready to go.  The quality is on par with DVD - it&#8217;s certainly not
HD, but I was watching on a 56&#8221; HDTV and it looked as good as any DVD I have.</p>

<p><strong>The Bad</strong><br/>
When I first installed the software, I got a message saying something was
wrong with my computer&#8217;s DRM configuration.  My only guess is that it has
something to do with being on a 64-bit - but I really don&#8217;t know.  The Unbox
software offers to help troubleshoot - so I did that and it found a patch to
automatically install&#8230;after that, everything went fine.  The download speed
is a bit slow - I rented 5 movies the first night (you can keep them for 30
days) at around 10pm.  By 8am or so the next morning, 4 of the 5 movies were
downloaded.  The files are between 1.5GB - 3GB - so it&#8217;s certainly going to
take a while to download them, but the speed could be just a tad better&#8230;but
it&#8217;s not a huge issue - just realize that you&#8217;ll need to wait about an hour or
so after you rent the movie before you can start playing it.  The biggest
issue I have with Amazon&#8217;s Unbox service is the lack of 5.1 channel audio -
the audio quality is decent, but it&#8217;s certainly not on the same level as a DVD
and there is no true surround sound.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>
There&#8217;s no question that Unbox is a great deal if you find a movie you&#8217;d like
to see for $0.99 - it&#8217;s the way to go at that price.  I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll be
using it for full price rentals though ($3.99) - for that price, I can get
NetFlix or Blockbuster Online (and better sound quality).  If Amazon can drop
the price to $1.99 for a one day rental, I&#8217;d be doing a lot more Unboxing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the things that has been hugely frustrating about my move to Vista is
that the backup tool is &#8220;dumbed down&#8221;.  It only copies files it wants to copy
and it requires that you backup C: whether you want to or not.  All I wanted
to do was schedule a daily backup from my data drive D: to my archive drive V:
- I want any type of file copied&#8230;just a basic mirror type copy.  Apparently
this is impossible in the standard windows backup application.  Enter Robocopy
- a small command-line utility from Microsoft (included in Vista) that does
exactly this.  Robocopy can take a source and destination and perform a mirror
copy without a problem - and since it&#8217;s a command-line application, you can
schedule it to run whenever you&#8217;d like.  It has tons of options to exclude
certain files/directories based on name, attribute, date, etc - but the basic
command to do a mirror copy is just this:</p>

<p><code>robocopy d:\ v:\ /MIR</code></p>

<p>Nifty huh?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw a link to a &#8220;nerd test&#8221; while reading over the old RSS feeds from some
fellow Knoxville bloggers (<a href="http://www.vinull.com/Blogs/Default.aspx">Mike </a>&amp;
<a href="http://www.dylanwolf.com/">Dylan</a>) and I had to take it.  Apparently, I&#8217;m a
Nerd God - but I&#8217;m not sure why&#8230;my answers weren&#8217;t really that &#8220;out there&#8221;
for most of the questions&#8230;  Of course, the fact that I don&#8217;t see anything
&#8220;wrong&#8221; with my answers is probably part of the issue&#8230;or maybe I&#8217;m just that
l33t.</p>

<p>My score on <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/tests/9935030990046738815/Nerd-Geek-or-%0ADork-">The Nerd? Geek? or Dork?
Test</a>:Modern, Cool Nerd</p>

<p>(60 % Nerd, 52% Geek, 43% Dork)</p>

<p><img src="http://is2.okcupid.com/users/104/656/10465692962375378952/mt1124997258.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>For The Record:</p>

<p>A Nerd is someone who is passionate about learning/being smart/academia. A
Geek is someone who is passionate about some particular area or subject, often
an obscure or difficult one. A Dork is someone who has difficulty with common
social expectations/interactions.</p>

<p>You scored better than half in Nerd and Geek, earning you the title of:
Modern, Cool Nerd.</p>

<p>Nerds didn&#8217;t use to be cool, but in the 90&#8217;s that all changed. It used to be
that, if you were a computer expert, you had to wear plaid or a pocket
protector or suspenders or something that announced to the world that you
couldn&#8217;t quite fit in. Not anymore. Now, the intelligent and geeky have eked
out for themselves a modicum of respect at the very least, and &#8220;geek is chic.&#8221;
The Modern, Cool Nerd is intelligent, knowledgable and always the person to
call in a crisis (needing computer advice/an arcane bit of trivia knowledge).
They are the one you want as your lifeline in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire
(or the one up there, winning the million bucks)!</p>
