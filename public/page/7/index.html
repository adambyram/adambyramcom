  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about whether it will be worth it to pick up an iPhone 2.0
on July 11th.  I&#8217;ve had the original iPhone for a while now (I picked it up
when they discontinued the 4GB version) and I have mixed feelings about it.
iPhone 1.0 is certainly the best PDA type phone I&#8217;ve ever used.  Everything is
very well designed, the battery life is good, sound quality is at least as
good as other phones I&#8217;ve had, the web browser is fantastic (unless you need
to view Flash content), and it&#8217;s a great iPod.</p>

<p>So why am I not already getting in line for 2.0?  Well, the first thing is
that the 2.0 software will run on the 1.0 hardware.  So any bug fixes, new
core application updates (e.g. scientific calculator), and other improvements
will work just fine on my original phone.  The only real hardware features
that matter for version 2.0 of the hardware are 3G network chip and the A-GPS
hardware.</p>

<p>2G is certainly not setting any speed records - but for the most part, it gets
the job done fine for me.  I use the web more on the iPhone than I have on any
other phone, but it&#8217;s still nothing at all compared to my web use on a real PC
- so 3G would be nice, but it&#8217;s nothing I can&#8217;t live without.  The main issue
with the 3G support is that my phone bill will go up by $10 per month for 2
years - so $240 total increase on top of buying the $200/$300 iPhone 2.0.
It&#8217;s not a horrible price increase, but in my particular situation, it&#8217;s
harder to justify the benefit outweighing the cost there.</p>

<p>The A-GPS is a bit more appealing though.  I have a handheld GPS unit from
Garmin, but it&#8217;s meant for hiking/geocaching type activities and not for
navigation.  I do like the idea of buying a cheap dash mount and then my
iPhone could be a very decent auto navigation system that moves around to
different cars easily.  Of course, this all depends on what GPS software is
released for the phone, but I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll see great things in this area.  The
other thing is that we really haven&#8217;t had a small GPS device that had an
always on broadband-link internet link - that could allow for all kinds of
interesting situations that make the GPS ability of the iPhone unlike anything
we&#8217;ve seen (for better or for worse).</p>

<p>At this point, my feeling is that I&#8217;m going to hold off for a bit and see what
applications come out that make use of iPhone 2.0 hardware features.  If they
are compelling enough, then I may make the jump, but I&#8217;m starting to get to
that point where I need to see real world benefits from new gadgets instead of
just the conceptual greatness of them…  Even on July 11th, the really amazing
applications for iPhone may not even be ready because of the way Apple has
chosen to limit the developer program - from the latest Apple keynote, it
sounds like some developers (and some SDK functionality) won&#8217;t even be ready
until September anyway.  We&#8217;ll see how things play out, but for now, I think
I&#8217;ll be keeping my $440.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I&#8217;m still working on my new blogs based on personal finance and
technology. So far, I have about 20 posts planned out for the personal finance
one, but I haven&#8217;t touched the technology one yet. I&#8217;ve been toying with
writing my own blog engine for the technology one - not because there aren&#8217;t
good blog engines out there, but more as a learning exercise (and it would use
some of the newer .Net features that the other blog engines haven&#8217;t used yet).
I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m going to do that now or not&#8230;</p>

<p>I have maybe 3 personal finance posts written, but still need to proofread
them before I make them public. My original plan was to not post anything on
the personal finance site until I have about 14 posts ready to go so I can
queue them up and start writing the next week or two worth of posts. That&#8217;s
still my plan as of right now, but this is going to be harder than I imagined
as far as keeping fresh content coming out. My target is to have one new
article a day during the week. I just have to figure out a rhythm and then
hopefully it&#8217;ll get easier, but I guess we&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>I may go ahead and start the tech site as well with a series of posts about
building a new blog engine. I&#8217;m not sure that I want to do that or not, but it
may be useful and having feedback on the design as I go along would be
helpful. Just have to find the time to do that too.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also been trying to get back into the habit of taking more photos and
getting a little photoblog up and running, but I think that one is on the back
burner for now. Just not enough time to do everything.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the end of last month, I paid off my student loans - it was quite hard to
write a $14,000 check, but once it was written, I didn&#8217;t regret it at all. It
feels great knowing they are out of the way. The only debt I have left at this
point (other than my primary mortgage) is a second mortgage I got when I
bought my house (my down payment didn&#8217;t go as far as I had hoped due to
closing costs, new house expenses, etc). This one is higher than my student
loans ($18,000), but it&#8217;s possible that I can knock it out by the end of the
year assuming no major financial issues arise between now and then. I may end
up having to sell some stuff to make this happen, but we&#8217;ll see how that
goes&#8230;I&#8217;m willing to do what is needed to take care of business.</p>

<p>This morning I sent in my monthly payment with a nice little $500 additional
principle attached and I&#8217;m already starting to feel better. :) Debt free, here
I come!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love <a href="http://www.scifi.com/rewind/">Sci Fi Rewind</a> - I haven&#8217;t had cable TV
for two years now and the one show I wanted to watch, but couldn&#8217;t find
legally online was Battlestar Galactica.  Now Sci Fi finally has it online for
free on Rewind.  BSG may have been on there earlier, but I never found it
until this season.  The thing I really like about Rewind is the fact that the
commercialsare short and the video automatically resumes once the commercials
are over.  I like ABC.com&#8217;s quality (particularly the HD feeds - really nice
video), but I really dislike having to click the done button once the ad is
over&#8230;I&#8217;m just fine with the ads, but please, show them and then get out of
the way.  I&#8217;m glad to see Sci Fi understands this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Wordpress 2.5 / New Theme</strong><br/>
I just finished updating this blog to use the new Wordpress 2.5 engine. It&#8217;s
really quite nice - everything on the admin side is much more refined that
before. The upgrade process is amazingly simple - you just upload the new
files, run upgrade.php, and in a minute or two (or longer if you have lots of
posts) you&#8217;re ready to go. While I was doing the upgrade, I decide I would go
ahead and update the theme as well. I liked the last theme, but I saw a new
theme that looked a little better to me - so I just popped it in since I was
already messing around with the site anyway. It is a bit more streamlined than
the last one and more my style.</p>

<p><strong>New Blogs</strong><br/>
Over the last week or so, I&#8217;ve been planning out some topics that I want to
blog about. I realize I haven&#8217;t been actively blogging for a while now, but
part of that is because I can&#8217;t decide what I want to include on this blog.
I&#8217;m always torn between putting all of my thoughts on this one blog or trying
to keep them on different blogs so that each blog has a particular topic. The
problem is that I would end up not posting at all. So, I have finally decided
I&#8217;m going to dedicate time each week (and perhaps more often) to blogging in
general and I have also decided I am creating more focused blogs going
forward. At this point in time, I&#8217;m going to start maintaining three different
blogs:</p>

<p><em>AdamByram.com</em></p>

<p>This blog will continue to be blog that is purely personal - more to
communicate with friends and such than anything else. If I have a topic that I
want to talk about that doesn&#8217;t fit into either of the two new blogs, it&#8217;ll
end up here.</p>

<p><em>New Personal Finance Site</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ll announce the name later once I finish getting things setup and get the
initial content loaded, but I&#8217;m creating a new site focused on providing
personal finance advice / observations for Generation Y. My generation has the
opportunity to do great things, but I keep hearing (and seeing) how so many in
this generation can&#8217;t (or don&#8217;t want) to manage money. To me, this is one of
the most important things someone can learn. Money isn&#8217;t the key to happiness,
but it&#8217;s one of those things what you need to understand and learn to use to
help you achieve your dreams. So I&#8217;m hoping my new site will prove useful to
people that want to start learning about personal finance, but don&#8217;t want to
get bogged down in the technical details of it.</p>

<p><em>New Software Development Site</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ll announce the URL for this once it&#8217;s up and running as well, but this will
be the place that all of my software development related ideas will go. At the
end of 2007, I started a new job at a software startup and I&#8217;ve had many
experiences there that I&#8217;d like to blog about (as far as what works, what
doesn&#8217;t, and things I&#8217;m learning about). I&#8217;ve wanted to do a blog like this
for a long time, so we&#8217;ll see how it goes, but I think it&#8217;ll be fun.</p>

<p><strong>I Tweet</strong><br/>
I have also started using Twitter. I seems like a nice way to stay on top of
the latest happenings, particularly in the software world. I don&#8217;t tweet non-
stop or anything, but I try to tweet every now and then. I have my latest
tweets in the sidebar of this blog and you&#8217;re welcome to follow me on Twitter
if you&#8217;ve like -
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/adambyram">http://www.twitter.com/adambyram/</a>.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all for now - more updates to come.</p>
