  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the end of last month, I paid off my student loans - it was quite hard to
write a $14,000 check, but once it was written, I didn&#8217;t regret it at all. It
feels great knowing they are out of the way. The only debt I have left at this
point (other than my primary mortgage) is a second mortgage I got when I
bought my house (my down payment didn&#8217;t go as far as I had hoped due to
closing costs, new house expenses, etc). This one is higher than my student
loans ($18,000), but it&#8217;s possible that I can knock it out by the end of the
year assuming no major financial issues arise between now and then. I may end
up having to sell some stuff to make this happen, but we&#8217;ll see how that
goes&#8230;I&#8217;m willing to do what is needed to take care of business.</p>

<p>This morning I sent in my monthly payment with a nice little $500 additional
principle attached and I&#8217;m already starting to feel better. :) Debt free, here
I come!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love <a href="http://www.scifi.com/rewind/">Sci Fi Rewind</a> - I haven&#8217;t had cable TV
for two years now and the one show I wanted to watch, but couldn&#8217;t find
legally online was Battlestar Galactica.  Now Sci Fi finally has it online for
free on Rewind.  BSG may have been on there earlier, but I never found it
until this season.  The thing I really like about Rewind is the fact that the
commercialsare short and the video automatically resumes once the commercials
are over.  I like ABC.com&#8217;s quality (particularly the HD feeds - really nice
video), but I really dislike having to click the done button once the ad is
over&#8230;I&#8217;m just fine with the ads, but please, show them and then get out of
the way.  I&#8217;m glad to see Sci Fi understands this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Wordpress 2.5 / New Theme</strong><br/>
I just finished updating this blog to use the new Wordpress 2.5 engine. It&#8217;s
really quite nice - everything on the admin side is much more refined that
before. The upgrade process is amazingly simple - you just upload the new
files, run upgrade.php, and in a minute or two (or longer if you have lots of
posts) you&#8217;re ready to go. While I was doing the upgrade, I decide I would go
ahead and update the theme as well. I liked the last theme, but I saw a new
theme that looked a little better to me - so I just popped it in since I was
already messing around with the site anyway. It is a bit more streamlined than
the last one and more my style.</p>

<p><strong>New Blogs</strong><br/>
Over the last week or so, I&#8217;ve been planning out some topics that I want to
blog about. I realize I haven&#8217;t been actively blogging for a while now, but
part of that is because I can&#8217;t decide what I want to include on this blog.
I&#8217;m always torn between putting all of my thoughts on this one blog or trying
to keep them on different blogs so that each blog has a particular topic. The
problem is that I would end up not posting at all. So, I have finally decided
I&#8217;m going to dedicate time each week (and perhaps more often) to blogging in
general and I have also decided I am creating more focused blogs going
forward. At this point in time, I&#8217;m going to start maintaining three different
blogs:</p>

<p><em>AdamByram.com</em></p>

<p>This blog will continue to be blog that is purely personal - more to
communicate with friends and such than anything else. If I have a topic that I
want to talk about that doesn&#8217;t fit into either of the two new blogs, it&#8217;ll
end up here.</p>

<p><em>New Personal Finance Site</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ll announce the name later once I finish getting things setup and get the
initial content loaded, but I&#8217;m creating a new site focused on providing
personal finance advice / observations for Generation Y. My generation has the
opportunity to do great things, but I keep hearing (and seeing) how so many in
this generation can&#8217;t (or don&#8217;t want) to manage money. To me, this is one of
the most important things someone can learn. Money isn&#8217;t the key to happiness,
but it&#8217;s one of those things what you need to understand and learn to use to
help you achieve your dreams. So I&#8217;m hoping my new site will prove useful to
people that want to start learning about personal finance, but don&#8217;t want to
get bogged down in the technical details of it.</p>

<p><em>New Software Development Site</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ll announce the URL for this once it&#8217;s up and running as well, but this will
be the place that all of my software development related ideas will go. At the
end of 2007, I started a new job at a software startup and I&#8217;ve had many
experiences there that I&#8217;d like to blog about (as far as what works, what
doesn&#8217;t, and things I&#8217;m learning about). I&#8217;ve wanted to do a blog like this
for a long time, so we&#8217;ll see how it goes, but I think it&#8217;ll be fun.</p>

<p><strong>I Tweet</strong><br/>
I have also started using Twitter. I seems like a nice way to stay on top of
the latest happenings, particularly in the software world. I don&#8217;t tweet non-
stop or anything, but I try to tweet every now and then. I have my latest
tweets in the sidebar of this blog and you&#8217;re welcome to follow me on Twitter
if you&#8217;ve like -
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/adambyram">http://www.twitter.com/adambyram/</a>.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all for now - more updates to come.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just spent a few hours working on a small iPhone app using the Beta 2 iPhone
SDK and thought I would share my my initial thoughts. Keep in mind that this
is the first time I&#8217;ve tried programming for OS X period and I spend 99% of my
time programming in C# with Microsoft&#8217;s Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Xcode itself is not even comparable to Visual Studio (I realize VS isn&#8217;t free,
but even the free Express Editions are much, MUCH better than Xcode). I found
out how to turn on the autocomplete functionality in Xcode, but it&#8217;s so
unhelpful that I may turn it back off since it seems to get in the way more
than it helps. I&#8217;m so accustomed to intellisense in VS - if you know nothing
about a library, you can use intellisense to get up and running in a flash
(usually), but not in Xcode. In Xcode, if you don&#8217;t know the frameworks you&#8217;re
using in and out, prepare to be checking out Safari constantly. The whole
Interface Builder application doesn&#8217;t really make sense to me yet, so I won&#8217;t
really comment on it yet. The error messages from Xcode have been fairly
useful so far, so that&#8217;s a good thing. The editor is decent in that it color
codes syntax for you and it does have the ability to jump directly to specific
functions from a menu (very similar to VS on this one).</p>

<p>Perhaps the bigger issue for people coming from a non-OS X background is the
knowledge of all of the frameworks. It&#8217;s not nearly as expansive as the .NET
framework, but it&#8217;s quite different - so you&#8217;re not going to be able to just
pick up the frameworks and hit the ground running. The documentation on
Apple&#8217;s dev center isn&#8217;t terrible&#8230;it takes a little bit to find what you
need, but it&#8217;s usually there somewhere. The naming convention does make it
pretty clear what you&#8217;re doing when calling a method, however, this is
realllllllly irritating without intellisense. I&#8217;m still trying to figure out
which classes do what and how to structure the View/Controllers in my
application. The sample apps are really helping out there. It does seem like I
have to write quite a bit of code for even fairly basic stuff. I just feel
really unproductive at this point..I know that&#8217;s mostly the learning curve
that I&#8217;m working through, but I would have thought Apple would have a better
developer toolset in this day and age. I don&#8217;t think the Objective-C language
will be that hard to pickup since it seems pretty logical once you get the
syntax for methods and method calls. The frameworks are going to take some
time and I&#8217;m sure things will still be changing between now and June, but
hopefully I&#8217;ll get this stuff figured out soon so I can have my little app up
and running in the simulator.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t normally blog about random things I see on the internet, but I ran
across an article by John C. Dvorak today (<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2278816,00.asp">The iPhone Is No
Desktop</a>) that really
annoyed me enough that I have to do this. John is basically saying that it&#8217;s
ridiculous that people are using the iPhone as a desktop computing platform
and that drives him crazy in many ways (10 ways to be exact). I don&#8217;t disagree
that the iPhone is not a &#8220;desktop replacement&#8221; in the typical sense, but what
bothers me is the fact that he thinks this is important.</p>

<p>In the technical world, so many people still believe the &#8220;platform&#8221; is the key
to everything. There are always discussions about which platform is the best -
laptop vs desktop vs PDA, Windows vs OS X vs Linux, Nikon vs Canon, Ford vs
Chevy - you get the point. That&#8217;s all fine and dandy and I don&#8217;t disagree that
sometimes there are certain benefits to using a specific platform. But the
kicker is that this is a stupid argument to begin with.</p>

<p>People don&#8217;t care about the platform. Even if you think you care, you probably
don&#8217;t when you get right down to it. For example, when I&#8217;m using the Windows
platform, I keep my current TODO list in Microsoft Outlook. Now that I also
work on a Mac, I decided to move my TODO list to an
<a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com">online</a> platform. Sure - I moved to a
different &#8220;platform&#8221; because it made it easier to get to my TODO list from
either OS, but it&#8217;s not the platform I really care about, it&#8217;s the data.</p>

<p>Whether my TODO list is on the web, on my desktop, on my iPhone, or on my
physical notepad, the platform is of little importance to me as long as my
list is there and it&#8217;s accessible when I need it. The platform only comes into
the picture when it can better enable me to manipulate my data in ways that
make me more efficient and effective. In reality, forget the platform and
focus on the data (or on the actions driven by the data) and you&#8217;ll see that
the platform being the key is a fallacy in this day and age.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I finally decided it is time for me to give Apple&#8217;s OS X a try. I&#8217;ve
been interested in seeing how things work on an Apple system, but I haven&#8217;t
really had a reason to buy an Apple machine. I still don&#8217;t <em>really</em> have a
reason, but I do want to play around with the iPhone SDK since I have some
ideas I&#8217;d like to try out so I used that as an excuse to buy a MacBook.</p>

<p>I ended up going with a black 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo version. It came with 2GB of
RAM, but that&#8217;s not really enough since I want to run VMWare Fusion so that I
can have Visual Studio 2005/2008 running in unity mode as well as SQL Server
2005/2008. So I had the MacBook upgraded to 4GB DDR2 RAM. Apple wanted $400
extra to add 2GB, but I used Crucial memory and did the upgrade myself for a
grand total of $111 including tax &amp; shipping. Not a bad deal since I
effectively saved nearly $300 by spending about 10 minutes swapping the RAM
sticks out.</p>

<p>So far, my impression of OS X is favorable. I&#8217;ve found replacements for
everything I typically used on Windows (except development tools and Quicken)
and I&#8217;m fairly happy with the way things work. For the first week or so, I
wasn&#8217;t sure that I was ever going to like OS X, but it&#8217;s one of those things
that grows on you. I wouldn&#8217;t make the claim that a lot of people when they
say Macs are easier to use than Windows. I think usability (as a whole) is
pretty similar between the two. OS X does have some standards that most
applications seem to follow which is better than on Windows, but the big
difference is that the &#8220;graphic arts&#8221; background of historical Mac users has
resulted in software developers taking more time to refine the user experience
to the point that things are a bit more logical than they are in Windows-based
counterparts.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really happy with the battery life on this thing. As long as I&#8217;m just
surfing the net, typing up blog posts, reading e-mail, and other light tasks,
I get fantastic battery life. I have a feeling even playing a DVD will still
result in good battery life, but it may not be the 4 or so hours I get now.
Time machine seems useful, although I keep forgetting to eject the disk before
I unplug the backup drive - so I think I&#8217;m going to end up getting the Time
Capsule before long, but I don&#8217;t really want to spend that money right now.</p>

<p>The one thing that is slightly disappointing thus far is that the MacBook gets
a little choppy when playing World of Warcraft with everything maxed out. It&#8217;s
not terrible and I do realize this machine has an integrated graphics card,
but WoW isn&#8217;t <em>that</em> demanding&#8230;either way, it&#8217;s still plenty playable, but
it&#8217;s just a little disappointing that it&#8217;s not as smooth as I&#8217;d like.</p>

<p>After I&#8217;ve used OS X for a few more weeks, I&#8217;ll post my updated impressions,
but so far so good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today was the first time I have ever changed the oil in my Explorer at home
without help.  In the past, I always took it to Ford to have the service done
- but I don&#8217;t like the Ford dealerships around here, so I wanted to do it
myself.  So last time I needed to change my oil, my Dad came up and helped me
change it.  His help was basically him doing the work, but me watching so I
had some idea of what was going on.  I&#8217;ve been overdue for a change for a bit,
so I decided to bite the bullet and just go for it today.  It really isn&#8217;t
that bad - I think the worst part of the whole thing is picking the proper oil
filter (there are tons of options out there).</p>

<p>The whole process of draining the oil is simple (just make sure you find the
correct drain plug&#8230;there may be more than just the oil one and if you pick
the wrong one&#8230;well&#8230;it probably wouldn&#8217;t be very pretty).  All you really
do is remove the plug, let the oil drain, replace the plug, remove the filter,
let remaining oil drain (if any), install the new filter, then just fill it
back up with fresh oil.  It is a bit messy, but I would rather spend 30
minutes doing it myself than to spend 1-2 hours (mostly waiting) for someone
else to do it - and you can save quite a bit of money depending on how cheap
you want to be.  (I think my total costs are about the same as the dealer, but
they could be way less if I tried and didn&#8217;t mind cheaper materials&#8230;)</p>

<p>Overall, the whole process is quite fun.  I think I&#8217;m going to start learning
more about cars now - they don&#8217;t seem that hard to understand&#8230;there are lots
of parts, but each part is pretty simple by itself.  We&#8217;ll see how it goes,
but hopefully I&#8217;ll learn enough that I can start to work on my car more to fix
the little issues that are popping up these days.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, it&#8217;s been nearly 2 months since I last blogged&#8230;  I&#8217;ve had quite a few
things going on in those two months, probably as much or more than when I
first moved to TN.  I started remodeling my kitchen - the counter-tops will be
delivered on Friday if all goes as planned, then I&#8217;ll get the sink in and
things will be all good.  I also changed jobs - I went from a relatively huge
public company with 55K-ish employees to a little bitty private software
company.  It&#8217;s been quite a change, but it&#8217;s great - it&#8217;s exactly the type of
job I was looking for and I&#8217;m enjoying the people there (although I do still
miss the people at the previous employer).  Overall though, it was the right
move and I have no regrets.  Anyway - I plan to start blogging a few times a
week at least from now on, but we&#8217;ll see what happens.</p>

impressions now that I&#8217;ve had plenty of time to check things out.  Overall,
I&#8217;m still very happy with my purchase, but there are a few annoying things:</p>

<p><strong>No Tasklist.</strong>  I don&#8217;t know why Apple decided to include all of the other PIM applications (contacts, calendar, notes), but decided to leave off a tasklist.  I really miss that feature from my Windows Mobile phone.  Hopefully Apple will add this soon.<br/>
<strong>Random Crashes.  </strong>It isn&#8217;t clear why it happens, but every once in a while, the iPhone will freeze and I&#8217;ll have to reboot.  Most of the time, I can just use the home button to kill the application and things are fine (although you usually lose whatever data you were updating, if any, when you do this).  It doesn&#8217;t take long to reset (maybe 20 seconds), but it&#8217;s still a bit of a pain.  My Windows Mobile phone and my PocketPC seem more stable (and I don&#8217;t have non-Apple applications on my phone).<br/>
<strong>No local downloading.</strong>  You can browse anything you want via Safari, but you can&#8217;t save anything.  I had one time when I really wanted to save a PDF document for viewing later or even e-mail it to myself&#8230;but the iPhone doesn&#8217;t support that.<br/>
<strong>No copy &amp; paste.  </strong>There have been a couple of times when I needed to take a snippit of a webpage (or even copy a URL) and paste it into a note or e-mail, but at present, there is no ability to copy and paste on the iPhone.<br/>
Of coure, there are still the original issues of not having Flash support and
no Assisted GPS.</p>

<p>But other than these few issues, the phone really works well.  The photo
viewer works great, the call quality has been excellent, the EDGE network in
my area is certainly speedy enough for everything I&#8217;ve needed, and the battery
life is better than I expected.  It may not be the perfect phone, but it&#8217;s
certainly a step in the right direction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a loyal reader of Business 2.0 for quite a few years now.  It is one
of the only magazines to which I subscribe.  I really look forward to getting
it each month to see all of the new business ideas and to read the magazine&#8217;s
take on various things.  Well, I just received my October copy and this is the
end of the road for Business 2.0.  Apparently they never figured out how to
get/keep advertisers interested in the magazine and it the magazine&#8217;s parent
company decided it didn&#8217;t bring in enough cash to trouble with keeping the
magazine alive.  Some of the staff are going to write for Fortune, but I just
don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll be the same.  All of the other magazines are stuffed with
ads, so I may buy a 100 page magazine, but only 40 of the pages are actual
content&#8230;and I&#8217;m not interested in flipping through ad after ad to find a
handful of stories that interest me - so I doubt I&#8217;ll pick up a subscription
to anything else to replace Business 2.0.  Oh well, it was good while it
lasted.</p>
