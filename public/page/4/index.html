  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just spent a few hours working on a small iPhone app using the Beta 2 iPhone
SDK and thought I would share my my initial thoughts. Keep in mind that this
is the first time I&#8217;ve tried programming for OS X period and I spend 99% of my
time programming in C# with Microsoft&#8217;s Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Xcode itself is not even comparable to Visual Studio (I realize VS isn&#8217;t free,
but even the free Express Editions are much, MUCH better than Xcode). I found
out how to turn on the autocomplete functionality in Xcode, but it&#8217;s so
unhelpful that I may turn it back off since it seems to get in the way more
than it helps. I&#8217;m so accustomed to intellisense in VS - if you know nothing
about a library, you can use intellisense to get up and running in a flash
(usually), but not in Xcode. In Xcode, if you don&#8217;t know the frameworks you&#8217;re
using in and out, prepare to be checking out Safari constantly. The whole
Interface Builder application doesn&#8217;t really make sense to me yet, so I won&#8217;t
really comment on it yet. The error messages from Xcode have been fairly
useful so far, so that&#8217;s a good thing. The editor is decent in that it color
codes syntax for you and it does have the ability to jump directly to specific
functions from a menu (very similar to VS on this one).</p>

<p>Perhaps the bigger issue for people coming from a non-OS X background is the
knowledge of all of the frameworks. It&#8217;s not nearly as expansive as the .NET
framework, but it&#8217;s quite different - so you&#8217;re not going to be able to just
pick up the frameworks and hit the ground running. The documentation on
Apple&#8217;s dev center isn&#8217;t terrible&#8230;it takes a little bit to find what you
need, but it&#8217;s usually there somewhere. The naming convention does make it
pretty clear what you&#8217;re doing when calling a method, however, this is
realllllllly irritating without intellisense. I&#8217;m still trying to figure out
which classes do what and how to structure the View/Controllers in my
application. The sample apps are really helping out there. It does seem like I
have to write quite a bit of code for even fairly basic stuff. I just feel
really unproductive at this point..I know that&#8217;s mostly the learning curve
that I&#8217;m working through, but I would have thought Apple would have a better
developer toolset in this day and age. I don&#8217;t think the Objective-C language
will be that hard to pickup since it seems pretty logical once you get the
syntax for methods and method calls. The frameworks are going to take some
time and I&#8217;m sure things will still be changing between now and June, but
hopefully I&#8217;ll get this stuff figured out soon so I can have my little app up
and running in the simulator.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t normally blog about random things I see on the internet, but I ran
across an article by John C. Dvorak today (<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2278816,00.asp">The iPhone Is No
Desktop</a>) that really
annoyed me enough that I have to do this. John is basically saying that it&#8217;s
ridiculous that people are using the iPhone as a desktop computing platform
and that drives him crazy in many ways (10 ways to be exact). I don&#8217;t disagree
that the iPhone is not a &#8220;desktop replacement&#8221; in the typical sense, but what
bothers me is the fact that he thinks this is important.</p>

<p>In the technical world, so many people still believe the &#8220;platform&#8221; is the key
to everything. There are always discussions about which platform is the best -
laptop vs desktop vs PDA, Windows vs OS X vs Linux, Nikon vs Canon, Ford vs
Chevy - you get the point. That&#8217;s all fine and dandy and I don&#8217;t disagree that
sometimes there are certain benefits to using a specific platform. But the
kicker is that this is a stupid argument to begin with.</p>

<p>People don&#8217;t care about the platform. Even if you think you care, you probably
don&#8217;t when you get right down to it. For example, when I&#8217;m using the Windows
platform, I keep my current TODO list in Microsoft Outlook. Now that I also
work on a Mac, I decided to move my TODO list to an
<a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com">online</a> platform. Sure - I moved to a
different &#8220;platform&#8221; because it made it easier to get to my TODO list from
either OS, but it&#8217;s not the platform I really care about, it&#8217;s the data.</p>

<p>Whether my TODO list is on the web, on my desktop, on my iPhone, or on my
physical notepad, the platform is of little importance to me as long as my
list is there and it&#8217;s accessible when I need it. The platform only comes into
the picture when it can better enable me to manipulate my data in ways that
make me more efficient and effective. In reality, forget the platform and
focus on the data (or on the actions driven by the data) and you&#8217;ll see that
the platform being the key is a fallacy in this day and age.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I finally decided it is time for me to give Apple&#8217;s OS X a try. I&#8217;ve
been interested in seeing how things work on an Apple system, but I haven&#8217;t
really had a reason to buy an Apple machine. I still don&#8217;t <em>really</em> have a
reason, but I do want to play around with the iPhone SDK since I have some
ideas I&#8217;d like to try out so I used that as an excuse to buy a MacBook.</p>

<p>I ended up going with a black 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo version. It came with 2GB of
RAM, but that&#8217;s not really enough since I want to run VMWare Fusion so that I
can have Visual Studio 2005/2008 running in unity mode as well as SQL Server
2005/2008. So I had the MacBook upgraded to 4GB DDR2 RAM. Apple wanted $400
extra to add 2GB, but I used Crucial memory and did the upgrade myself for a
grand total of $111 including tax &amp; shipping. Not a bad deal since I
effectively saved nearly $300 by spending about 10 minutes swapping the RAM
sticks out.</p>

<p>So far, my impression of OS X is favorable. I&#8217;ve found replacements for
everything I typically used on Windows (except development tools and Quicken)
and I&#8217;m fairly happy with the way things work. For the first week or so, I
wasn&#8217;t sure that I was ever going to like OS X, but it&#8217;s one of those things
that grows on you. I wouldn&#8217;t make the claim that a lot of people when they
say Macs are easier to use than Windows. I think usability (as a whole) is
pretty similar between the two. OS X does have some standards that most
applications seem to follow which is better than on Windows, but the big
difference is that the &#8220;graphic arts&#8221; background of historical Mac users has
resulted in software developers taking more time to refine the user experience
to the point that things are a bit more logical than they are in Windows-based
counterparts.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really happy with the battery life on this thing. As long as I&#8217;m just
surfing the net, typing up blog posts, reading e-mail, and other light tasks,
I get fantastic battery life. I have a feeling even playing a DVD will still
result in good battery life, but it may not be the 4 or so hours I get now.
Time machine seems useful, although I keep forgetting to eject the disk before
I unplug the backup drive - so I think I&#8217;m going to end up getting the Time
Capsule before long, but I don&#8217;t really want to spend that money right now.</p>

<p>The one thing that is slightly disappointing thus far is that the MacBook gets
a little choppy when playing World of Warcraft with everything maxed out. It&#8217;s
not terrible and I do realize this machine has an integrated graphics card,
but WoW isn&#8217;t <em>that</em> demanding&#8230;either way, it&#8217;s still plenty playable, but
it&#8217;s just a little disappointing that it&#8217;s not as smooth as I&#8217;d like.</p>

<p>After I&#8217;ve used OS X for a few more weeks, I&#8217;ll post my updated impressions,
but so far so good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today was the first time I have ever changed the oil in my Explorer at home
without help.  In the past, I always took it to Ford to have the service done
- but I don&#8217;t like the Ford dealerships around here, so I wanted to do it
myself.  So last time I needed to change my oil, my Dad came up and helped me
change it.  His help was basically him doing the work, but me watching so I
had some idea of what was going on.  I&#8217;ve been overdue for a change for a bit,
so I decided to bite the bullet and just go for it today.  It really isn&#8217;t
that bad - I think the worst part of the whole thing is picking the proper oil
filter (there are tons of options out there).</p>

<p>The whole process of draining the oil is simple (just make sure you find the
correct drain plug&#8230;there may be more than just the oil one and if you pick
the wrong one&#8230;well&#8230;it probably wouldn&#8217;t be very pretty).  All you really
do is remove the plug, let the oil drain, replace the plug, remove the filter,
let remaining oil drain (if any), install the new filter, then just fill it
back up with fresh oil.  It is a bit messy, but I would rather spend 30
minutes doing it myself than to spend 1-2 hours (mostly waiting) for someone
else to do it - and you can save quite a bit of money depending on how cheap
you want to be.  (I think my total costs are about the same as the dealer, but
they could be way less if I tried and didn&#8217;t mind cheaper materials&#8230;)</p>

<p>Overall, the whole process is quite fun.  I think I&#8217;m going to start learning
more about cars now - they don&#8217;t seem that hard to understand&#8230;there are lots
of parts, but each part is pretty simple by itself.  We&#8217;ll see how it goes,
but hopefully I&#8217;ll learn enough that I can start to work on my car more to fix
the little issues that are popping up these days.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, it&#8217;s been nearly 2 months since I last blogged&#8230;  I&#8217;ve had quite a few
things going on in those two months, probably as much or more than when I
first moved to TN.  I started remodeling my kitchen - the counter-tops will be
delivered on Friday if all goes as planned, then I&#8217;ll get the sink in and
things will be all good.  I also changed jobs - I went from a relatively huge
public company with 55K-ish employees to a little bitty private software
company.  It&#8217;s been quite a change, but it&#8217;s great - it&#8217;s exactly the type of
job I was looking for and I&#8217;m enjoying the people there (although I do still
miss the people at the previous employer).  Overall though, it was the right
move and I have no regrets.  Anyway - I plan to start blogging a few times a
week at least from now on, but we&#8217;ll see what happens.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had my 4GB iPhone for about a month now so I thought I would share my
impressions now that I&#8217;ve had plenty of time to check things out.  Overall,
I&#8217;m still very happy with my purchase, but there are a few annoying things:</p>

<p><strong>No Tasklist.</strong>  I don&#8217;t know why Apple decided to include all of the other PIM applications (contacts, calendar, notes), but decided to leave off a tasklist.  I really miss that feature from my Windows Mobile phone.  Hopefully Apple will add this soon.<br/>
<strong>Random Crashes.  </strong>It isn&#8217;t clear why it happens, but every once in a while, the iPhone will freeze and I&#8217;ll have to reboot.  Most of the time, I can just use the home button to kill the application and things are fine (although you usually lose whatever data you were updating, if any, when you do this).  It doesn&#8217;t take long to reset (maybe 20 seconds), but it&#8217;s still a bit of a pain.  My Windows Mobile phone and my PocketPC seem more stable (and I don&#8217;t have non-Apple applications on my phone).<br/>
<strong>No local downloading.</strong>  You can browse anything you want via Safari, but you can&#8217;t save anything.  I had one time when I really wanted to save a PDF document for viewing later or even e-mail it to myself&#8230;but the iPhone doesn&#8217;t support that.<br/>
<strong>No copy &amp; paste.  </strong>There have been a couple of times when I needed to take a snippit of a webpage (or even copy a URL) and paste it into a note or e-mail, but at present, there is no ability to copy and paste on the iPhone.<br/>
Of coure, there are still the original issues of not having Flash support and
no Assisted GPS.</p>

<p>But other than these few issues, the phone really works well.  The photo
viewer works great, the call quality has been excellent, the EDGE network in
my area is certainly speedy enough for everything I&#8217;ve needed, and the battery
life is better than I expected.  It may not be the perfect phone, but it&#8217;s
certainly a step in the right direction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a loyal reader of Business 2.0 for quite a few years now.  It is one
of the only magazines to which I subscribe.  I really look forward to getting
it each month to see all of the new business ideas and to read the magazine&#8217;s
take on various things.  Well, I just received my October copy and this is the
end of the road for Business 2.0.  Apparently they never figured out how to
get/keep advertisers interested in the magazine and it the magazine&#8217;s parent
company decided it didn&#8217;t bring in enough cash to trouble with keeping the
magazine alive.  Some of the staff are going to write for Fortune, but I just
don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll be the same.  All of the other magazines are stuffed with
ads, so I may buy a 100 page magazine, but only 40 of the pages are actual
content&#8230;and I&#8217;m not interested in flipping through ad after ad to find a
handful of stories that interest me - so I doubt I&#8217;ll pick up a subscription
to anything else to replace Business 2.0.  Oh well, it was good while it
lasted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while back, I posted that I made the move to 64-bit Vista.  Then I got an
iPhone, which doesn&#8217;t have 64-bit drivers, so I downgraded to Vista 32-bit.
Well, this weekend, I have had another ordeal - I just finished installing
32-bit Vista again.  My primary hard drive is beginning to fail apparently -
it did have a handful of bad sectors.  I&#8217;m fine with that, except Vista
refused to boot up so I can do a couple of things like de-activate iTunes,
check for any files that I may need to save (mainly installers - I keep all
data on a different drive), etc.  Well - after trying to boot into Vista in
every way I could think of, I decided I&#8217;ll go ahead and reinstall.  Guess what
- the install DVD fails to startup as well!  It would try to startup, but then
it would hang at the loading screen (black screen with the little green
progress bar at the bottom).  It appears that Vista&#8217;s boot process (from DVD
or HDD) can be hung when there is a corrupted partion.  I can understand the
HDD install not booting, but come on - why can&#8217;t the DVD boot?</p>

<p>I ended up getting an iso of the <a href="http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/">Ultimate Boot
CD</a>, running SeaTools to fix up the drive, and
then using the disk partioning tools there to wipe the drive clean.  After
that, the Vista DVD was able to boot just fine and now I&#8217;m finally back up and
running.  This is one of the reasons I keep wanting to switch to Apple though
- I know they have issues as well, but I can&#8217;t believe the various issues I
keep hitting with Vista&#8230;granted, I&#8217;m a power user so I don&#8217;t expect most of
the issues I see would cause a problem with &#8220;normal&#8221; home users, but geez,
it&#8217;s bad when I&#8217;m tempted to downgrade back to XP at least once a week.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>1) Cut the cable</strong><br/>
Do you really need those 100 channels you never watch?  I have an HDTV that
picks up over the air channels and I can assure you that my FOX, NBC, ABC, and
PBS look just as good, if not better, than anything you would get on cable.
It does mean giving up certain channels (I do miss Sci-Fi, Discovery, and a
couple of other ones), but it saves a ton of money and you don&#8217;t have to deal
with the cable company.</p>

<p><strong>2) Check the unit price on grocery items</strong><br/>
I find it amazing that identical items in the grocery have vastly different
pricing.  Two different brands of the same pasta sauce may have the same price
per item, but if you look at the unit price, you may see that one of them
actually gives you quite a bit more sauce for the same price (you can&#8217;t always
tell this by the size of the container).  Another really surprising thing is
that larger &#8220;family size&#8221; items are often more per unit than the &#8220;regular&#8221;
size item - sounds strange, but if you check out the unit price on the labels,
you&#8217;ll see what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>

<p><strong>3) Use fans instead of air conditioner when possible</strong><br/>
This certainly depends on where you live, but around here, it&#8217;s quite hot in
the summer.  If I know I&#8217;m only going to be in a couple of rooms in the house,
I&#8217;ll just open a window or use a fan since there is no point to chilling the
whole house.</p>

<p><strong>4) Never buy on credit (specifically don&#8217;t pay interest)</strong><br/>
Hopefully it&#8217;s obvious that it&#8217;s always worse to end up paying more for an
item than what the store charged&#8230;if not, these tips probably won&#8217;t help&#8230;
The best thing you can do for yourself is to stop using credit cards - go with
your bank check card.</p>

<p><strong>5) Minimize impulse buying (still working on this one - but it usually works well with #7)</strong><br/>
This is one of the hardest things for me to do - you see the new gadget come
out, want the extra pack of candy in the grocery that you didn&#8217;t plan on,
decide it&#8217;s time to buy an HDTV&#8230;  The best way I&#8217;ve found to minimize this
is to keep very little money in my checking account - I move it all to
investments (either mutual funds or savings accounts like ING Direct).  That
way, I can get the money if I need it, but I don&#8217;t have enough to make a huge
purchase unless I go through a transfer process that takes 3-5 days&#8230;by then,
I may decide I didn&#8217;t really need the item anyway.</p>

<p><strong>6) Know where your money is going / Implement a budget</strong><br/>
It&#8217;s really important that you know where your money is going - I don&#8217;t
particularly like doing a true budget, so I track all expenses (including
categories) in Quicken, then review spending each month to see how I&#8217;m doing
against my mental budget.  Doing a &#8220;real&#8221; budget would be more helpful, but I
haven&#8217;t found a nice way to do the budget the way I want in Quicken.</p>

<p><strong>7) Treat yourself to something nice</strong><br/>
When I first decided I would start cutting my expenses and saving up to pay
off my student loans early, I kept myself from buying anything unless I really
needed it.  The problem I ran into was that sometimes it would feel even worse
than being broke - sometimes you just need to have a little something extra.
I&#8217;m taking buying a $50 video game or $100 night out - not buying a car or
something crazy like that.  If you don&#8217;t treat yourself, what will probably
happen is that you&#8217;ll eventually break down and spend like crazy for a bit and
it&#8217;ll put you back to square one - sounds crazy I know, but trust me, it&#8217;s
better to set aside $100/mo blow money instead of spending $3000 one month
because you couldn&#8217;t take it anymore.</p>

<p><strong>8) Use utilities efficiently</strong><br/>
Nothing special here - use compact florescent light bulbs, turn off the lights
when you&#8217;re not in the room, minimize hot water usage, don&#8217;t water the lawn if
you don&#8217;t have to, etc.  Turning off the computer at night can save about
$20/mo - you&#8217;ll be surprised at home much it costs to use different items you
have around the house.</p>

<p><strong>9) Be as frugal as possible, but not cheap (buy good quality / be proactive)</strong><br/>
I&#8217;ll explain this one via an example - 6 months ago, I bought a little
battery-powered drill for $30.  I used it to drive in some screws here and
there and it worked fine.  I recently decided to put in new cabinets and
needed to do more heavy duty work.  Well, the drill basically bit the dust -
it couldn&#8217;t take the stress.  So now I need a new drill&#8230; If I would have
went ahead and bought a good quality drill from the start for $100 or so, I
would have come out much better than having to go buy a new one now (plus the
time lost messing with the cheap drill trying to finish the job).  These days,
I try to buy the middle priced version of whatever I&#8217;m buying - I don&#8217;t care
for paying premium prices, but I don&#8217;t mind paying a few dollars more when
those few dollars create enough value to justify the extra expense.</p>

<p><strong>10) Avoid marketing as much as possible</strong><br/>
This sounds dumb, but the more marketing you&#8217;re exposed to, the more stuff
you&#8217;ll want to buy - that&#8217;s the point of marketing after all.  Now that
doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;ll buy something just because you saw a single ad, but
it does mean that the more ads you see, the harder #5 gets.  I know I&#8217;m going
to have to stay away from Apple keynotes - I don&#8217;t know why, but they always
make me want to buy the newest thing Apple thought up&#8230;so far, I&#8217;ve been able
to resist, but it&#8217;d be even better if I would just stop watching&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A quick FYI on Amazon&#8217;s Unbox service.  I had 7 rentals on my computer that I
had not been able to watch yet, but I needed to downgrade my Vista install to
32-bit (from the 64-bit version).  So I copied off the Amazon videos and
uninstalled the Unbox software.  Then after the new version of Vista was
installed, I tried to re-import the videos into Unbox (they provide an Import
function).  What I didn&#8217;t realize is that the Unbox agreement says you can&#8217;t
move rental videos from your original download location&#8230;  I&#8217;m not sure if
Amazon Customer Service is going to help here or not, but I think they will
this one time.  Something to keep in mind if you&#8217;re thinking about getting a
video rental.</p>
