  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I moved to Tennessee, I&#8217;ve wanted to go try out skiing - mainly because
it&#8217;s relatively close to where I live, so it alwayed seemed like a good thing
to try while I&#8217;m in the area.  Well, yesterday, I tried skiing for the first
time&#8230;</p>

<p>I went to <a href="http://www.obergatlinburg.com/">Ober Gatlinburg</a> with a couple of
co-workers.  I haven&#8217;t heard great things about Ober, but it took less than an
hour to get there and we all had free passes for the ski lift because of a
Hardee&#8217;s promotion earlier in the week.  My friends let me borrow the basic
items that I&#8217;d need (other than the skis themselves) so the whole trip really
only cost $13 for skis&#8230;although I did buy a pair of goggles while I was
there, but I could have done without them.</p>

<p>The overall ski experience was interesting.  I&#8217;ve never waterskied, so this
was my first time on skis period.  After falling down the &#8220;ski school&#8221; slope a
couple of times, my friends decided it was time we all take the ski lift up to
a long, but easy run.  I didn&#8217;t think I was ready for that, but eventually I
went anyway.  Those ski lifts are harder to exit than I would have thought -
in fact, I never was able to successfully exit the thing without falling (I
could slide away, but never got very far).</p>

<p>As far as skiing down the mountain, well, when the snow was fresh (it was
snowing a lot while we were there), I could control my speed pretty well in
general.  I still fell a lot, but it was usually because I hit a steeper area
and I&#8217;d lose my balance when I sped up too much.  I never really figured out
how to turn with the skis, I did figure out how to wobble a bit so I could
shift my weight slightly to turn just a little, but never got the hang of
doing a regular turn.</p>

<p>As the night went on, I think the slopes got more icy.  It certainly got
pretty chilly, but by the last run I made, I could barely control the ski
speed even though I was doing the same thing I did before.  So my last run was
relatively fast, but a bit more painful since I kept falling faster and pretty
repeatedly.</p>

<p>Today, I&#8217;m totally sore.  I kept falling in the same position, so I banged up
one side pretty good (but I was never going very fast so no lasting injuries
or anything)&#8230;some good bruises though.  I wish I got the hang of skiing and
I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s just like a friend was telling me - I just had to let go when I
started going faster and just go with it.  The problem is that I&#8217;m not a big
adrenaline junkie - so I don&#8217;t want to go fast or feel that out of control, so
I never could quite let go and I&#8217;m pretty positive that is what made me fall
so much once I started going at a good pace (because I know I kept leaning
back too far and my skis came out from under me).  Overall, I&#8217;m glad I went
since I&#8217;ve wanted to try skiing, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be going back.  Skiing
just isn&#8217;t for me, but it was certainly an interesting experience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now seems as good a time as any to post my a list of goals I want to
accomplish in 2009. I think everything is quite realistic. So, I now have 364
days left to:</p>

<li>Maintain at least a 3 month emergency fund (currently at 12 months, but expect some of this to use used for other financial goals)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Health</h4>

<ul>
<li>Get weight to 190 or lower and keep it there (~25 lbs to lose)</li>
<li>Decrease caffeine intake - and keep it down (target is around 1 12oz can of soda per day or less)</li>
<li>Drink more water (no particular amount - just when I&#8217;m thirsty, grab a water instead of a soda)</li>
<li>Cook (healthly-ish) meals at home more than I eat out (including lunch)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Read at least 1 non-fiction (but not computer related) book a month</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, 2008 is almost over and overall, it really hasn&#8217;t been that bad.  This
year I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Switched to using Apple OS X as my primary desktop environment (after I purchased my first Apple computer - a 13&#8221; MacBook)</li>
<li>Remodeled my kitchen (well, mostly&#8230;a couple of minor things are still on the TODO list)</li>
<li>Canceled my Lowe&#8217;s credit card after having absolutely terrible service from them (during my kitchen remodel)</li>
<li>Totally paid off my student loan debt</li>
<li>Celebrated my grandfather&#8217;s 80th birthday and then attended his funeral less than a week later</li>
<li>Sold my first &#8220;real&#8221; software product - <a href="http://www.cogitu.com/Products/Budgee/">Budgee</a> - a budgeting app for Apple&#8217;s iPhone</li>
<li>Celebrated my 1 year anniversary at my new employer - finally doing software development for a software company, which is what I had been wanting to do</li>
<li>Lost ~30 lbs by joining a gym &amp; getting a personal trainer (although I&#8217;ve slacked off over the last couple of months&#8230;time to get going on that again)</li>
<li>Built up a 1 year emergency fund &#8220;just in case&#8221;</li>
<li>Finally got around to visiting old college friends back in Alabama and had one friend finally make it up to Tennessee to visit
While 2008 was pretty fun overall, I&#8217;m pretty sure 2009 is going to be awesome
in quite a few ways&#8230;  Here&#8217;s looking forward to a whole new year and lots of
exciting adventures to come&#8230;</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick post to say I&#8217;m still around&#8230;  I haven&#8217;t been updating this
blog much because things got quite busy at work and after that settled down, I
started working on a small iPhone app that I&#8217;ve been wanting for a long time.
On October 14th, I finally released my app (called Budgee) to the Apple App
Store.  So far, it&#8217;s been a blast - I use the app daily, I&#8217;ve heard good
things overall from those that have contacted me about it, and I have some
interesting things I&#8217;d like to do with it in the future&#8230;plus several more
apps that are in the queue.  If you&#8217;re interested in seeing what I&#8217;m up to in
the iPhone world, the blog I&#8217;ll be updating for that (and I will be updating
it) is: http://blog.cogitu.com (if you want to see Budgee, it&#8217;s here:
http://www.cogitu.com/Products/Budgee/).</p>

<p>Anyway - not much else to say other than I&#8217;m still not going to be posting too
many updates to this blog in the near future.  I&#8217;m really trying to focus most
of my free time getting my new iPhone venture up and running at full speed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, about three months ago, I applied for the Apple iPhone Developer Program
so I could build a few apps for my iPhone.  Last Friday, I was finally
approved.  I&#8217;m not sure why it took so long for Apple to open things up, but
I&#8217;m glad they finally released the finished SDK and let everyone in.  I&#8217;m sure
in the next couple of months, there will be some awesome applications out
there.  I&#8217;ve been working most of the weekend on my first app, but I&#8217;ll talk
more about that later.</p>

<p>I did notice that one of the top 10 apps (#9 currently) is &#8220;iBeer&#8221; - it uses
the iPhone&#8217;s accelerometer to display &#8220;beer&#8221; on the iPhone&#8217;s screen that looks
as if it were in a glass when you tip the iPhone up to your mouth.  I think
it&#8217;s an interesting use of the hardware and all, but I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s a
top 10 <strong>non-free</strong> app.  I mean, this thing costs $3 + tax&#8230;  Just amazing
what people value these days (but congratz to the developer for coming up with
that - paying off big time I&#8217;m sure).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, I posted about how I was giving up OS X after 3 months of use.
Well, after 24 hours of use, I remembered why I tried to switch to mac to
start with&#8230;activation.  I&#8217;m one of those people that likes to reformat a
machine when it&#8217;s getting too much crud - after all, as a software developer,
I try out new things when they come out and that&#8217;s not really a good thing for
the system if you want to keep it clean and fast.  The problem, is that I
don&#8217;t really want to tie Vista to my MacBook since I may want to go back to OS
X at some point&#8230;  I remembered I had my dual core Athlon 64 desktop w/
triple monitors just sitting in a closet, so found some desk space and fired
it up.  It&#8217;s so much easier to get my .NET development on using my desktop.
I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s just habit, but it just doesn&#8217;t feel right on the laptop (and I
miss my third screen).</p>

<p>So, now my MacBook is transitioning back to OS X Leopard (looking forward to
Snow Leopard though if they really do speed things up), but my main workhorse
is my trusty old desktop.  I really hate not using Vista since I purchased it
at retail, but XP just feels better (and Vista doesn&#8217;t like my desktop&#8230;but
XP flies on it thanks to the ton o&#8217; RAM and 10K RPM SATA drive).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really surprised that I didn&#8217;t like having a dedicated Vista laptop, but
it just didn&#8217;t feel right once everything was said and done.  With this new
setup, things seem just right&#8230;old habits die hard.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been about 3 months since I purchased by MacBook.  Since then, I&#8217;ve been
using OS X Leopard as my main OS at home - the only exception was when I
needed to pop back to Quicken 2006.  Overall, OS X wasn&#8217;t a bad experience,
but there wasn’t anything magical about it either.</p>

<p>Perhaps jumping into OS X with Leopard was the wrong thing to do.  I&#8217;ve read
quite a lot about how Tiger was a very streamlined and efficient OS and how
Leopard came along and added bloat.  I&#8217;ve had very little experience with
Tiger (or earlier versions) of OS X, so I can&#8217;t compare first hand, however, I
can confirm that Vista Ultimate 64-bit runs much faster than OS X Leopard on
this MacBook, which is a shame.  From what I&#8217;ve seen, Leopard has plenty of
flashy effects along with a few nice features (e.g. Time Machine), but the
bottom line is that I&#8217;m not more productive using a Mac.  I realize that part
of that is caused by the fact that I&#8217;ve been a Windows power user for quite a
long time.  The other part of that, is that Mac apps in general are fun to use
and nice to look at, but your options in that software are very limited.  I
thought I would like the simplicity of Mail, iCal, and Address Book, but the
reality is that I miss Outlook - there&#8217;s something nice about having one
application open instead of 3.</p>

<p>The other catch is that I&#8217;ve stopped doing development at home because it&#8217;s a
bit of a hassle to switch to the BootCamp partition whenever I want to play
around with .NET.  I tried VMWare Fusion and it worked great until I tried to
resize the Vista partition, then VMWare got confused and couldn&#8217;t figure out
how to boot Vista.  I realize these are petty items, the reality is that I&#8217;m
still tied to MS and using OS X right now just gets in the way (I can buy
another dedicated MS PC, but I don&#8217;t see a reason to do that at this point).
My day job is at a Microsoft shop, my financial software is Windows based, my
hobby development is usually in .NET as well, so it&#8217;s just so much easier to
just stay in the MS OS world.</p>

<p>Secondary reasons for the move are the fact that Vista just plain runs better
on the MacBook that Leopard ever did.  Leopard wasn&#8217;t super sluggish, but it
was never all that snappy.  The other reason is that everything on Mac seems
to cost more - the hardware is comparable to higher end PC prices, but it
seems like all the basic applications I liked would all cost $30-$70 a pop.
Which isn&#8217;t that expensive, but it just feels like even the little things are
a bit pricy.  Maybe that&#8217;s just perception though - I know the tools I use on
Vista aren&#8217;t cheap either (in fact, they are much, much more expensive than
the equivalent Mac software), but the reality is that I already own them.</p>

<p>In any event, I just finished by MacBook reformat so now I&#8217;m up and running
with Vista and it feels like home - it may not be quite as fun to use, but for
me, it&#8217;s really about the productivity, and that is one thing Vista can handle
just fine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about whether it will be worth it to pick up an iPhone 2.0
on July 11th.  I&#8217;ve had the original iPhone for a while now (I picked it up
when they discontinued the 4GB version) and I have mixed feelings about it.
iPhone 1.0 is certainly the best PDA type phone I&#8217;ve ever used.  Everything is
very well designed, the battery life is good, sound quality is at least as
good as other phones I&#8217;ve had, the web browser is fantastic (unless you need
to view Flash content), and it&#8217;s a great iPod.</p>

<p>So why am I not already getting in line for 2.0?  Well, the first thing is
that the 2.0 software will run on the 1.0 hardware.  So any bug fixes, new
core application updates (e.g. scientific calculator), and other improvements
will work just fine on my original phone.  The only real hardware features
that matter for version 2.0 of the hardware are 3G network chip and the A-GPS
hardware.</p>

<p>2G is certainly not setting any speed records - but for the most part, it gets
the job done fine for me.  I use the web more on the iPhone than I have on any
other phone, but it&#8217;s still nothing at all compared to my web use on a real PC
- so 3G would be nice, but it&#8217;s nothing I can&#8217;t live without.  The main issue
with the 3G support is that my phone bill will go up by $10 per month for 2
years - so $240 total increase on top of buying the $200/$300 iPhone 2.0.
It&#8217;s not a horrible price increase, but in my particular situation, it&#8217;s
harder to justify the benefit outweighing the cost there.</p>

<p>The A-GPS is a bit more appealing though.  I have a handheld GPS unit from
Garmin, but it&#8217;s meant for hiking/geocaching type activities and not for
navigation.  I do like the idea of buying a cheap dash mount and then my
iPhone could be a very decent auto navigation system that moves around to
different cars easily.  Of course, this all depends on what GPS software is
released for the phone, but I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll see great things in this area.  The
other thing is that we really haven&#8217;t had a small GPS device that had an
always on broadband-link internet link - that could allow for all kinds of
interesting situations that make the GPS ability of the iPhone unlike anything
we&#8217;ve seen (for better or for worse).</p>

<p>At this point, my feeling is that I&#8217;m going to hold off for a bit and see what
applications come out that make use of iPhone 2.0 hardware features.  If they
are compelling enough, then I may make the jump, but I&#8217;m starting to get to
that point where I need to see real world benefits from new gadgets instead of
just the conceptual greatness of them…  Even on July 11th, the really amazing
applications for iPhone may not even be ready because of the way Apple has
chosen to limit the developer program - from the latest Apple keynote, it
sounds like some developers (and some SDK functionality) won&#8217;t even be ready
until September anyway.  We&#8217;ll see how things play out, but for now, I think
I&#8217;ll be keeping my $440.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I&#8217;m still working on my new blogs based on personal finance and
technology. So far, I have about 20 posts planned out for the personal finance
one, but I haven&#8217;t touched the technology one yet. I&#8217;ve been toying with
writing my own blog engine for the technology one - not because there aren&#8217;t
good blog engines out there, but more as a learning exercise (and it would use
some of the newer .Net features that the other blog engines haven&#8217;t used yet).
I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m going to do that now or not&#8230;</p>

<p>I have maybe 3 personal finance posts written, but still need to proofread
them before I make them public. My original plan was to not post anything on
the personal finance site until I have about 14 posts ready to go so I can
queue them up and start writing the next week or two worth of posts. That&#8217;s
still my plan as of right now, but this is going to be harder than I imagined
as far as keeping fresh content coming out. My target is to have one new
article a day during the week. I just have to figure out a rhythm and then
hopefully it&#8217;ll get easier, but I guess we&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>I may go ahead and start the tech site as well with a series of posts about
building a new blog engine. I&#8217;m not sure that I want to do that or not, but it
may be useful and having feedback on the design as I go along would be
helpful. Just have to find the time to do that too.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also been trying to get back into the habit of taking more photos and
getting a little photoblog up and running, but I think that one is on the back
burner for now. Just not enough time to do everything.</p>
