  <div class="entry-content"><p>This year, I&#8217;m setting 5 major goals for myself. I have several other
behaviors to change/actions to take this year, but I&#8217;m only considering these
five items my goals since they are realistic, actionable, and measurable.</p>

<h3>Release a new app or website</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working on several ideas over the last year or so and I&#8217;m going to
really push to get at least one new project released publicly. I&#8217;m not going
to be more specific other than the new &#8220;thing&#8221; will must be something anyone
can sign up for or download. Open source, closed source, free, or paid -
doesn&#8217;t matter - I just want to complete v1.0 of a new project.</p>

<h3>Max out 401K &amp; Roth IRA</h3>

<p>Pretty simple - $16,500 pre-tax dollars into the 401K and $5,000 of after-tax
dollars into a Roth IRA.</p>

<h3>Lose weight</h3>

<p>Nothing special about this goal. I&#8217;m targeting 35 pounds lost by the end of
the year. I&#8217;ve had this one on my goal list for a while, so it&#8217;s time to
finally knock this one off.</p>

<h3>Write a journal entry a day</h3>

<p>This is a new one for me. I wanted to do a 365 photo project, but I&#8217;d really
like to do more writing&#8230;so a 365 writing project it is. I won&#8217;t be
publishing these, but I&#8217;m really enjoying it so far (even though I&#8217;m only 3
days in).</p>

<p>2011 feels different from years past, so I have pretty high hopes for
accomplishing these goals (as well as several other things).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in January, I posted my [top three goals for
2010.](http://www.adambyram.com/2010/01/10/my-goals-the-2010-edition/</p>

<p>)</p>

<p>So how did I do? Well&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Goal: Get Healthy</strong><br/>
Result: Failed - I totally bombed this one. A lot of changes happened in 2010
that distracted me from this goal. This WILL be happening in 2011.</p>

<p><strong>Goal: Side Income to Livable Levels</strong><br/>
Result: Success / Not Applicable - This originally came about because I wanted
to leave me previous job and work for myself. I did end up working for myself
anyway, but I didn&#8217;t get my side income to livable levels. Having said that, I
did start a new job which negated this goal (and resulted in an even better
outcome in a lot of ways). I still love the idea of running my own business
and maybe it&#8217;ll happen when it&#8217;s time. I tried to force it this time and that
wasn&#8217;t the right way to do it. In the meantime, everything is working out
pretty awesomely.</p>

<p><strong>Goal: See a Space Shuttle Launch (in person)</strong><br/>
Result: Success - I hit a home run on this one. I watched the next to last
launch of Atlantis in May (from Titusville) and then I won the lottery by
being selected for the NASA Tweetup for Discovery&#8217;s final flight. While I
didn&#8217;t see Discovery launch (yet - 2011 goal now), I did get an amazing
experience at NASA including standing just a few hundred yards from Discovery
on the launchpad.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#8217;m OK with my progress (all things considered). I&#8217;m disappointed in
myself for not making progress on my &#8220;Get Healthy&#8221; goal, but it was a bit of a
crazy year. I&#8217;m happy with my direction heading into 2011 so 2010 was
definitely not a waste. While I may not have accomplished all of the goals I
wanted, 2011 is looking to be the best year yet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of you probably know I just spent a week down at NASA for the STS-133
Tweetup. 150 of us were down there to watch Discovery lift off for her final
flight. It was an amazing trip even though we didn&#8217;t get to see Discovery
launch (we may get a chance later). I&#8217;m going to post lots of info about the
trip and my thoughts about it, but I need a bit of time to catch up on things,
process my photos, and generally relax a bit. I&#8217;ll try to have some info up
late this week, but in the meantime, here are some things to check out:</p>

<p>We have a group setup on Flickr where lots of people are sending Tweetup
photos. If you&#8217;re curious about the things we saw, take a look here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/group%0As/sts133tweetup/pool/">http://www.flickr.com/groups/sts133tweetup/pool/</a></p>

<p>If you want to see <em>exactly</em> what we saw, you get watch the Justin.tv stream
of pretty much the whole tweetup right here (note - lots of videos here&#8230;not
official NASA videos and lots of them are from the parties. I know the actual
tweetup content is in here somewhere though):</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all for now. More to come in a couple of days.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This weekend was my first time camping at Elkmont. My Dad &amp; I used to go
camping a good bit when I was little, so I thought he would like going camping
in the Smokies. I heard good things about Elkmont and they happened to have a
creekside site available for the weekend, so that&#8217;s what I reserved.</p>

<p>We arrived around 3pm on Saturday and got checked in pretty fast. Our campsite
was G11 which was just a quick trip down the road from the ranger station. We
had one of the small sites - just a tent pad, fire ring, a picnic table, and a
single parking spot. The tent went up pretty quickly, so we got small fire
going early in the evening and just sat around the campsite. We ended up
cooking some steaks and potatoes for dinner - the cooking part went fine, but
we didn&#8217;t bring quite enough light for the picnic table. We had plenty of
flashlights, but we didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d need a big lantern&#8230;turns out, the
potatoes &amp; steak took longer than we expected and it gets dark early&#8230;so we
basically ate in the dark. We stayed up pretty late (11:30-ish) and then
turned in for the night. We decided to cook some eggs &amp; bacon the following
morning, walked a good bit of the Elkmont site, and then headed out. A few
photos from the trip are here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fl%0Aickr.com/photos/adambyram/sets/72157625235026618/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/adambyram/sets/72157625235026618/</a></p>

<p>So what did I think? Well&#8230;</p>

<h3>Proximity to other campers</h3>

<p>I was surprised how close we were to other campers. Some of the areas seem to
be spaced out a bit more, but the &#8220;G&#8221; section was pretty packed. If you&#8217;re
wanting to get away from everything, Elkmont may not do it for you. I think
I&#8217;d like it more with a camper so some of the sounds are muffled. In a tent,
every foot step, car, motorcycle, kid&#8217;s bike, etc makes quite a bit of noise
and you can&#8217;t really escape it. Section &#8220;G&#8221; also allows generators during the
day, so quite a few sites had those going during the day.</p>

<h3>Pay attention to the rules (i.e. keep food safe)</h3>

<p>We didn&#8217;t have this problem, but some of our nearby campers did&#8230; The rules
you agree to when you reserve a spot state that you&#8217;ll keep your food locked
in your car at all times unless you&#8217;re physically with the food at the site.
Some guys a couple of sites over from us didn&#8217;t do this and left their cooler
our while they went for a motorcycle ride. Shortly after they left, the
rangers came by and confiscated all of their food (including the cooler
itself). On top of that, anyone caught breaking the rules is fined $75. So if
you camp at Elkmont, read &amp; follow by the rules&#8230;they are serious about them
and they really do patrol frequently to verify compliance.</p>

<h3>Jerks nearby</h3>

<p>So being in close proximity to other campers isn&#8217;t bad normally - it&#8217;s a
little noisier as I mentioned, but nothing too bad&#8230;unless you&#8217;re camping
next to jerks. I don&#8217;t know what was up with the people that were right next
to us at G9, but their freaking car alarm went on for minutes at a time FOUR
times during the night. Not right next to each other either - the first time
was around midnight and they seemed to happen nearly once an hour all the way
up to 3am. At that point, my Dad went over to talk to them and one of the
campers was out trying to quite the truck. I have no idea what was going on,
but a truck alarm blaring at 3am about 100 ft from your head is not awesome.
Another nearby camper told us the following morning that these people had the
alarm go off EIGHT times the night before! If you have great campers nearby,
this will be ok, but since you have no control over who camps next to you, you
should be aware that you too could have a jerk camper during your relaxing
camping experience.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>It was a good trip and we&#8217;ll probably be back to Elkmont in the future. I
didn&#8217;t really sleep at all due to cars going by (G11 is just across the Little
River from the entrance road to the campground and cars sound pretty loud),
some animal(s) around the campsite overnight (no idea what it was&#8230;but
something was walking around outside for a while late in the night), and the
freaking car alarm. The site was nice in general though and my Dad really
enjoyed it. I think my ideal wilderness retreat would be to go to a secluded
cabin with a great mountain view &amp; an internet connection&#8230;but I can
certainly deal with a regular camping trip every now and then.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you read my blog in the browser and not via RSS, you may notice the look
has changed a bit. Everything is streamlined and I have a more minimalist
style. The blog is back to nice looking, easy to read text with minimal
distractions. I&#8217;ve decided a lot of things in my life are too cluttered these
days, so I&#8217;m starting my decluttering right here on the web. In addition to
the style, I&#8217;ve also simplified the categories on the blog to focus on the
things I really care about - life, money (personal finance), photography, and
tech. I&#8217;ll expand those if the need arises, but having the categories this way
seems to give me a little more mental clarity. The RSS feed is also going
through FeedBurner now - your feed should have automatically swapped over, so
hopefully that won&#8217;t cause any issues.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also going to start blogging more. I know I&#8217;ve said that before, but I
mean it this time. I need to work on my writing and now I have more incentive
than normal since I do a good bit of tech writing at work. I can&#8217;t promise the
topics will always be interesting, but I have a lot of things I want to talk
about. I have quite a few folders of ideas to post, but I have been holding
them because I originally thought I&#8217;d have a different site for each topic,
but I&#8217;ve decided against that. It&#8217;s easier to keep all of the content in one
place and I&#8217;m more likely to write this way, so we&#8217;ll see how it goes. More to
come in the near future&#8230;stay tuned.</p>
