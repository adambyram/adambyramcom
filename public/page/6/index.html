			First Time Skiing</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Since I moved to Tennessee, I&rsquo;ve wanted to go try out skiing &ndash; mainly because
it&rsquo;s relatively close to where I live, so it alwayed seemed like a good thing
to try while I&rsquo;m in the area.  Well, yesterday, I tried skiing for the first
time&hellip;</p>

<p>I went to <a href="http://www.obergatlinburg.com/">Ober Gatlinburg</a> with a couple of
co-workers.  I haven&rsquo;t heard great things about Ober, but it took less than an
hour to get there and we all had free passes for the ski lift because of a
Hardee&rsquo;s promotion earlier in the week.  My friends let me borrow the basic
items that I&rsquo;d need (other than the skis themselves) so the whole trip really
only cost $13 for skis&hellip;although I did buy a pair of goggles while I was
there, but I could have done without them.</p>

<p>The overall ski experience was interesting.  I&rsquo;ve never waterskied, so this
was my first time on skis period.  After falling down the &ldquo;ski school&rdquo; slope a
couple of times, my friends decided it was time we all take the ski lift up to
a long, but easy run.  I didn&rsquo;t think I was ready for that, but eventually I
went anyway.  Those ski lifts are harder to exit than I would have thought &ndash;
in fact, I never was able to successfully exit the thing without falling (I
could slide away, but never got very far).</p>

<p>As far as skiing down the mountain, well, when the snow was fresh (it was
snowing a lot while we were there), I could control my speed pretty well in
general.  I still fell a lot, but it was usually because I hit a steeper area
and I&rsquo;d lose my balance when I sped up too much.  I never really figured out
how to turn with the skis, I did figure out how to wobble a bit so I could
shift my weight slightly to turn just a little, but never got the hang of
doing a regular turn.</p>

<p>As the night went on, I think the slopes got more icy.  It certainly got
pretty chilly, but by the last run I made, I could barely control the ski
speed even though I was doing the same thing I did before.  So my last run was
relatively fast, but a bit more painful since I kept falling faster and pretty
repeatedly.</p>

<p>Today, I&rsquo;m totally sore.  I kept falling in the same position, so I banged up
one side pretty good (but I was never going very fast so no lasting injuries
or anything)&hellip;some good bruises though.  I wish I got the hang of skiing and
I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s just like a friend was telling me &ndash; I just had to let go when I
started going faster and just go with it.  The problem is that I&rsquo;m not a big
adrenaline junkie &ndash; so I don&rsquo;t want to go fast or feel that out of control, so
I never could quite let go and I&rsquo;m pretty positive that is what made me fall
so much once I started going at a good pace (because I know I kept leaning
back too far and my skis came out from under me).  Overall, I&rsquo;m glad I went
since I&rsquo;ve wanted to try skiing, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be going back.  Skiing
just isn&rsquo;t for me, but it was certainly an interesting experience.</p>

			My Goals for 2009</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Now seems as good a time as any to post my a list of goals I want to
accomplish in 2009. I think everything is quite realistic. So, I now have 364
days left to:</p>

<h4>Financial</h4>

<ul>
<li>Fully fund 2008 &amp; 2009 Roth IRAs</li>
<li>Pay off second mortgage OR refinance into single mortgage (with much lower rate and no PMI)</li>
<li>Get my side income up to the point I could live off of it if the need arose (NOT trying to get this to replace my actual income level&hellip;although that would be fantastic if it did)</li>
<li>Maintain at least a 3 month emergency fund (currently at 12 months, but expect some of this to use used for other financial goals)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Health</h4>

<ul>
<li>Get weight to 190 or lower and keep it there (~25 lbs to lose)</li>
<li>Decrease caffeine intake &ndash; and keep it down (target is around 1 12oz can of soda per day or less)</li>
<li>Drink more water (no particular amount &ndash; just when I&rsquo;m thirsty, grab a water instead of a soda)</li>
<li>Cook (healthly-ish) meals at home more than I eat out (including lunch)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Personal &amp; Professional Development / Other</h4>

<ul>
<li>Read at least 1 non-fiction (but not computer related) book a month</li>
<li>Read at least 1 fiction book a month</li>
<li>Attend WWDC 2009 (contingent on other financial goals being met/on track in May)</li>
<li>Get my passport</li>
<li>Write at least one blog post per week on this blog &ndash; just to start writing more</li>
</ul>

			Looking Back on 2008</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, 2008 is almost over and overall, it really hasn&rsquo;t been that bad.  This
year I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Switched to using Apple OS X as my primary desktop environment (after I purchased my first Apple computer &ndash; a 13&#8221; MacBook)</li>
<li>Remodeled my kitchen (well, mostly&hellip;a couple of minor things are still on the TODO list)</li>
<li>Canceled my Lowe&rsquo;s credit card after having absolutely terrible service from them (during my kitchen remodel)</li>
<li>Totally paid off my student loan debt</li>
<li>Celebrated my grandfather&rsquo;s 80th birthday and then attended his funeral less than a week later</li>
<li>Sold my first &ldquo;real&rdquo; software product &ndash; <a href="http://www.cogitu.com/Products/Budgee/">Budgee</a> &ndash; a budgeting app for Apple&rsquo;s iPhone</li>
<li>Celebrated my 1 year anniversary at my new employer &ndash; finally doing software development for a software company, which is what I had been wanting to do</li>
<li>Lost ~30 lbs by joining a gym &amp; getting a personal trainer (although I&rsquo;ve slacked off over the last couple of months&hellip;time to get going on that again)</li>
<li>Built up a 1 year emergency fund &ldquo;just in case&rdquo;</li>
<li>Finally got around to visiting old college friends back in Alabama and had one friend finally make it up to Tennessee to visit
While 2008 was pretty fun overall, I&rsquo;m pretty sure 2009 is going to be awesome
in quite a few ways&hellip;  Here&rsquo;s looking forward to a whole new year and lots of
exciting adventures to come&hellip;</li>

			Checking In</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Just a quick post to say I&rsquo;m still around&hellip;  I haven&rsquo;t been updating this
blog much because things got quite busy at work and after that settled down, I
started working on a small iPhone app that I&rsquo;ve been wanting for a long time.
On October 14th, I finally released my app (called Budgee) to the Apple App
Store.  So far, it&rsquo;s been a blast &ndash; I use the app daily, I&rsquo;ve heard good
things overall from those that have contacted me about it, and I have some
interesting things I&rsquo;d like to do with it in the future&hellip;plus several more
apps that are in the queue.  If you&rsquo;re interested in seeing what I&rsquo;m up to in
the iPhone world, the blog I&rsquo;ll be updating for that (and I will be updating
it) is: <a href="http://blog.cogitu.com">http://blog.cogitu.com</a> (if you want to see Budgee, it&rsquo;s here:
<a href="http://www.cogitu.com/Products/Budgee/">http://www.cogitu.com/Products/Budgee/</a>).</p>

<p>Anyway &ndash; not much else to say other than I&rsquo;m still not going to be posting too
many updates to this blog in the near future.  I&rsquo;m really trying to focus most
of my free time getting my new iPhone venture up and running at full speed.</p>
