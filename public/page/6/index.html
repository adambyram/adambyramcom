  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now seems as good a time as any to post my a list of goals I want to
accomplish in 2009. I think everything is quite realistic. So, I now have 364
days left to:</p>

<h4>Financial</h4>

<ul>
<li>Fully fund 2008 &amp; 2009 Roth IRAs</li>
<li>Pay off second mortgage OR refinance into single mortgage (with much lower rate and no PMI)</li>
<li>Get my side income up to the point I could live off of it if the need arose (NOT trying to get this to replace my actual income level&#8230;although that would be fantastic if it did)</li>
<li>Maintain at least a 3 month emergency fund (currently at 12 months, but expect some of this to use used for other financial goals)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Health</h4>

<ul>
<li>Get weight to 190 or lower and keep it there (~25 lbs to lose)</li>
<li>Decrease caffeine intake - and keep it down (target is around 1 12oz can of soda per day or less)</li>
<li>Drink more water (no particular amount - just when I&#8217;m thirsty, grab a water instead of a soda)</li>
<li>Cook (healthly-ish) meals at home more than I eat out (including lunch)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Personal &amp; Professional Development / Other</h4>

<ul>
<li>Read at least 1 non-fiction (but not computer related) book a month</li>
<li>Read at least 1 fiction book a month</li>
<li>Attend WWDC 2009 (contingent on other financial goals being met/on track in May)</li>
<li>Get my passport</li>
<li>Write at least one blog post per week on this blog - just to start writing more</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, 2008 is almost over and overall, it really hasn&#8217;t been that bad.  This
year I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Switched to using Apple OS X as my primary desktop environment (after I purchased my first Apple computer - a 13&#8221; MacBook)</li>
<li>Remodeled my kitchen (well, mostly&#8230;a couple of minor things are still on the TODO list)</li>
<li>Canceled my Lowe&#8217;s credit card after having absolutely terrible service from them (during my kitchen remodel)</li>
<li>Totally paid off my student loan debt</li>
<li>Celebrated my grandfather&#8217;s 80th birthday and then attended his funeral less than a week later</li>
<li>Sold my first &#8220;real&#8221; software product - <a href="http://www.cogitu.com/Products/Budgee/">Budgee</a> - a budgeting app for Apple&#8217;s iPhone</li>
<li>Celebrated my 1 year anniversary at my new employer - finally doing software development for a software company, which is what I had been wanting to do</li>
<li>Lost ~30 lbs by joining a gym &amp; getting a personal trainer (although I&#8217;ve slacked off over the last couple of months&#8230;time to get going on that again)</li>
<li>Built up a 1 year emergency fund &#8220;just in case&#8221;</li>
<li>Finally got around to visiting old college friends back in Alabama and had one friend finally make it up to Tennessee to visit
While 2008 was pretty fun overall, I&#8217;m pretty sure 2009 is going to be awesome
in quite a few ways&#8230;  Here&#8217;s looking forward to a whole new year and lots of
exciting adventures to come&#8230;</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick post to say I&#8217;m still around&#8230;  I haven&#8217;t been updating this
blog much because things got quite busy at work and after that settled down, I
started working on a small iPhone app that I&#8217;ve been wanting for a long time.
On October 14th, I finally released my app (called Budgee) to the Apple App
Store.  So far, it&#8217;s been a blast - I use the app daily, I&#8217;ve heard good
things overall from those that have contacted me about it, and I have some
interesting things I&#8217;d like to do with it in the future&#8230;plus several more
apps that are in the queue.  If you&#8217;re interested in seeing what I&#8217;m up to in
the iPhone world, the blog I&#8217;ll be updating for that (and I will be updating
it) is: http://blog.cogitu.com (if you want to see Budgee, it&#8217;s here:
http://www.cogitu.com/Products/Budgee/).</p>

<p>Anyway - not much else to say other than I&#8217;m still not going to be posting too
many updates to this blog in the near future.  I&#8217;m really trying to focus most
of my free time getting my new iPhone venture up and running at full speed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, about three months ago, I applied for the Apple iPhone Developer Program
so I could build a few apps for my iPhone.  Last Friday, I was finally
approved.  I&#8217;m not sure why it took so long for Apple to open things up, but
I&#8217;m glad they finally released the finished SDK and let everyone in.  I&#8217;m sure
in the next couple of months, there will be some awesome applications out
there.  I&#8217;ve been working most of the weekend on my first app, but I&#8217;ll talk
more about that later.</p>

<p>I did notice that one of the top 10 apps (#9 currently) is &#8220;iBeer&#8221; - it uses
the iPhone&#8217;s accelerometer to display &#8220;beer&#8221; on the iPhone&#8217;s screen that looks
as if it were in a glass when you tip the iPhone up to your mouth.  I think
it&#8217;s an interesting use of the hardware and all, but I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s a
top 10 <strong>non-free</strong> app.  I mean, this thing costs $3 + tax&#8230;  Just amazing
what people value these days (but congratz to the developer for coming up with
that - paying off big time I&#8217;m sure).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, I posted about how I was giving up OS X after 3 months of use.
Well, after 24 hours of use, I remembered why I tried to switch to mac to
start with&#8230;activation.  I&#8217;m one of those people that likes to reformat a
machine when it&#8217;s getting too much crud - after all, as a software developer,
I try out new things when they come out and that&#8217;s not really a good thing for
the system if you want to keep it clean and fast.  The problem, is that I
don&#8217;t really want to tie Vista to my MacBook since I may want to go back to OS
X at some point&#8230;  I remembered I had my dual core Athlon 64 desktop w/
triple monitors just sitting in a closet, so found some desk space and fired
it up.  It&#8217;s so much easier to get my .NET development on using my desktop.
I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s just habit, but it just doesn&#8217;t feel right on the laptop (and I
miss my third screen).</p>

<p>So, now my MacBook is transitioning back to OS X Leopard (looking forward to
Snow Leopard though if they really do speed things up), but my main workhorse
is my trusty old desktop.  I really hate not using Vista since I purchased it
at retail, but XP just feels better (and Vista doesn&#8217;t like my desktop&#8230;but
XP flies on it thanks to the ton o&#8217; RAM and 10K RPM SATA drive).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really surprised that I didn&#8217;t like having a dedicated Vista laptop, but
it just didn&#8217;t feel right once everything was said and done.  With this new
setup, things seem just right&#8230;old habits die hard.</p>
