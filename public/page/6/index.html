  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m really wanting a new phone - my current one (SMT 5600) has been through a
lot and it&#8217;s about time to upgrade.   One of the phones I&#8217;ve been considering
is Apple&#8217;s new iPhone.  After doing quite a bit of research on the web, I
don&#8217;t believe the iPhone is going to be my next phone for a few reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>No integrated GPS </strong>If I&#8217;m going to pay $500+ for a new phone that has really nice mapping software like the iPhone, it&#8217;s sure as heck going to have GPS support.  Sure, the iPhone may eventually support assisted GPS (where it uses the cell towers to determine the location) and that may work out well, but for now, it doesn&#8217;t look like any form of GPS will be supported in the near future.</li>
<li><strong>No tactile QWERTY keyboard </strong>I type at a decent speed on a regular keyboard and I know that speed will be drastically reduced on a mobile device, but I just can&#8217;t imagine how the virtual keyboard will work on the iPhone.  Apple says it takes a week or so to get the hang of it and then you&#8217;ll be typing at a productive speed, but I&#8217;m not so sure.  I type fast by not looking at the keys and can &#8220;feel&#8221; when I hit the wrong key and I don&#8217;t think that will translate well to the iPhone.  I have no doubt that the virtual keyboard will be really nice compared to using the standard phone keypad for text entry, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll be quite as good as a Treo/Blackberry type keyboard.  Maybe I&#8217;m under-estimating Apple here, but from the blogs I&#8217;ve seen where people tried to use the iPhone, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m too far off.  I&#8217;m sure this won&#8217;t be a huge issue for people that just want to send quick text messages, but if you&#8217;re like me and want the ability to respond to e-mails or post to a blog etc., then this may be an issue.</li>
<li><strong>Closed API and no SDK </strong>I realize most people don&#8217;t care about this at all, but as a software developer, I see this is quite a big issue.  Apple has said that third-party applications will be allowed on the phone as widgets (meaning HTML/JavaScript code that runs inside of Safari in the case of the iPhone).  It&#8217;s possible that Apple will expose key parts of the iPhone&#8217;s OS through javascript, but I haven&#8217;t heard anyone mention it yet.  To me, this means that you&#8217;ll have a powerful UNIX-based phone that really doesn&#8217;t do anything more than show pretty web widgets unless Apple decides to create more &#8220;real&#8221; applications for the phone.  Just seems like a waste of hardware too have so much potential trapped inside there with no way to access it - but maybe the widget interface will turn out better than anyone can imagine.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I went to see the new Fantastic Four movie - I hadn&#8217;t planned on seeing it
since I wasn&#8217;t terribly thrilled with the first one.  I never read the comics,
but I do know some of the FF storyline somehow (a cartoon maybe?  can&#8217;t
remember&#8230;).  Anyway, a friend said he saw some reviews that said the movie
was pretty good - so I decided to tag along.</p>

<p>The first hour or so wasn&#8217;t all that great.  It was almost entertaining, but
not quite.  I think the little bit of the silver surfer story that I did know
ruined this part for me - they spend so long trying to figure out what is
going on that it just gets plain boring (not to mention the fact that it never
really goes into detail about what IS going on&#8230;).  I would say this part of
the movie was a little worse than Part 1.</p>

<p>The second half (more specifically, the last 20 or so minutes) was where the
good stuff can be found.  I actually liked end quite a bit - much better than
the first movie.  I won&#8217;t go into any details or anything, but it was
entertaining.  I don&#8217;t know that it made up for the entire $8.50 I spent to
see the movie, but it certainly helped.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a FF fan, then maybe you&#8217;ll love the movie.  If you&#8217;ve seen the
other movies out right now, then might as well see this one too.  If you&#8217;re
looking for the most entertainment bang for your buck, well, this probably
isn&#8217;t the film for you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw Shrek 3 this weekend - I wasn&#8217;t sure what it would be like&#8230;but lemme
tell you, it&#8217;s good.  It was really funny - most of the humor was for the
general audience, but there were the occasional parts that only the adults
will get.  All in all, the storyline was decent enough - it&#8217;s more along the
lines of the second movie instead of the first&#8230;basically expect more humor
with a so-so story line.  There weren&#8217;t really any big surprises, but it was
really entertaining.  I think my favorite part was when they meet the wizard
(a close tie with some of Puss&#8217; jokes).   If you liked Shrek 1 or 2, you owe
it to yourself to see Shrek the Third.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, I decided I don&#8217;t like using this particular URL for my personal
finance blog (called &#8220;The Business of Life&#8221;).  So, I&#8217;ve updated the site (both
the theme and Wordpress), removed the old posts, and I&#8217;m ready to start again.
If you&#8217;re looking for the old posts, well, for the time being, they don&#8217;t
exist anymore.  But, they will return to the internet in some form in a bit,
but at a different URL (and I&#8217;m not going to mention the URL because I decided
the finance blog should be more anonymous to be useful).  So sorry for any
confusion with people looking for old posts, but the stats didn&#8217;t show all
that many people looking at most of the pages anyway.</p>

<p>As far as this new blog goes, you can expect to see just about anything here -
well, except work stuff.  Since I work for a public company and such, I won&#8217;t
be talking about work on here.  Everything else is fair game - we&#8217;ll just see
where things go from here.</p>
