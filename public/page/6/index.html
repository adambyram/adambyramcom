  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I set a goal for myself at the beginning of 2007 - that goal was to be debt
free except the house by the end of the year.  (Yeah - I drank the <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com">Dave
Ramsey kool-aid</a>&#8230;well, mostly at least&#8230;)  After
the first few months, I figured out how to trim my expenses even more and
figured out that I could actually pay off my student loans by my birthday (end
of September).  At the end of 2006, I paid off all credit cards and any other
foolishness I had - so I only have 3 &#8220;debt&#8221; items laying around these days:
student loans (~$15K total), 1st mortgage, and 2nd mortgage.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m on track to pay off my student loans by the end of September, but it&#8217;s
really tempting to pay off the 2nd mortgage first.  Both are about the same
amount (second mortgage is a few thousand higher, but that just means waiting
a month or so to pay it off if I chose that route), but the interest rate on
my student loan is 4.25% while the second mortgage is at 8.25%.  Because of
that (and the terms around each loan), my student loan payment is $125 a month
and my 2nd mortgage is $190&#8230;so paying it off first would free up $190
instead of only $125.</p>

<p>But here&#8217;s the catch (and the reason I&#8217;ll probably still pay off the student
loans first) - in a worst case scenario, I could probably sell the house and
at least break even (if not, I wouldn&#8217;t owe much).  In that case, both
mortgages would be taken care of, but the student loan will still be there.
No matter what happens (practically&#8230;there are a few legal things that I&#8217;m
going to ignore), I&#8217;m stuck with the student loan for up to 14 more years (the
remaining length of the loan).  It seems really risky to me to pay off the
second mortgage before the student loans.</p>

<p>Realistically, my plan would be to pay off the student loans first (just to
have them out of the way), buy some new camera equipment (as a celebration
type thing&#8230;and because I &#8220;need&#8221; it&#8230;), fill up the 5K for Roth IRA 2008,
then focus on knocking out my 2nd mortgage as quickly as possible.  If raises
go as usual next year at work, I can probably expect I would have the income
to do all of the above between now and Jan 1 2009.  It&#8217;s just a question of
what else will happen between now and then.</p>

<p>Anyway - I&#8217;m 80% sure I&#8217;m going to go ahead and pay off the student loans as
planned, but it&#8217;s still a hard choice because of the interest rates (and the
fact that I could invest it and do decently as well).  But when it comes down
to it, I&#8217;ve really liked not having credit card payments and it feels great
not to be paying on my everyday items anymore.  I can only imagine what it
will feel like to have the house paid off one day&#8230;  The really amazing thing
is that it&#8217;s not <em>that</em> hard - oh, it&#8217;s hard, but not <em>that</em> hard.  At the
very least, it&#8217;s been interesting having to make all these choices now that I
have a &#8220;real world&#8221; income.</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I&#8217;ve had a copy of Windows XP Professional x64 for quite a while - I never
bothered to install it because all of my machines, except one, are 32-bit
only.  My main desktop has an older Athlon 64 (3500+) processor, but I
recently bumped up the RAM to 3GB for some photography and development work -
so I decided it was time to give the 64-bit world a try.  I&#8217;m not sure why
exactly, but after about 2 weeks of running x64, my machine is still blazing
fast.  With XP Pro 32-bit, my machine was really taking a while to startup and
would get bogged down quite easily.  I&#8217;m sure I have less software installed
on the machine now, but I have my main applications installed now and things
are quite nice.</p>

<p>I was a bit worried that some of my hardware wouldn&#8217;t be supported under a
64-bit Windows OS (which is one reason I haven&#8217;t been in a hurry to jump on
the Vista bandwagon&#8230;I know there is 32-bit Vista, but if I have a 64-bit
machine, I&#8217;m running a 64-bit OS&#8230;).  Anyway - the experience of getting
things up and running was really quite nice.  Some applications went and
installed just fine without any modification at all.  Others did require that
I download a 64-bit version of the installer (as the 32-bit installer refused
to run at all), but this was pretty painless.  Even my Brother multi-function
laser printer and my Garmin Legend C GPS device had 64-bit compatible drivers,
which was pretty surprising.  Interestingly enough, the only application I&#8217;ve
really had trouble with is Apple&#8217;s iTunes.  I have the latest version of the
software and the install process went fine, but when it came time to sync my
iPod, I got all sorts of errors.  I ended up &#8220;restoring&#8221; (i.e. reformatting
basically) my iPod 3 times, disabling all syncing except music, and rebooting
a few times&#8230;now things &#8220;work&#8221;.  I still get funky error messages every once
in a while, but my music plays on the PC and my iPod appears to have my music
again.  I noticed that Apple has a page saying 64-bit Windows (XP Pro and
Vista) aren&#8217;t actually supported by iTunes at this time - which is kinda funny
because now I&#8217;m seeing quite a few posts from <strike>iBroke</strike> iPhone
owners that are upset that they can&#8217;t sync the iPhone since they run 64-bit
OSes.</p>

<p>Anyway, I thought I would post my base application list in case anyone else is
curious about what works in the 64-bit world:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adobe Photoshop CS2</li>
<li>Adobe Photoshop Lightroom v1.1</li>
<li>Microsoft Office 2003</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2005</li>
<li>Microsoft Virtual PC 2007 (* 64-bit installer required)</li>
<li>Garmin City Navigator v7 (* after 64-bit driver download for GPS unit)</li>
<li>Quicken 2006 Home and Business</li>
<li>Microsoft ActiveSync</li>
<li>Apple Safari (Beta 3)</li>
<li>Alcohol 52%</li>
<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m really wanting a new phone - my current one (SMT 5600) has been through a
lot and it&#8217;s about time to upgrade.   One of the phones I&#8217;ve been considering
is Apple&#8217;s new iPhone.  After doing quite a bit of research on the web, I
don&#8217;t believe the iPhone is going to be my next phone for a few reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>No integrated GPS </strong>If I&#8217;m going to pay $500+ for a new phone that has really nice mapping software like the iPhone, it&#8217;s sure as heck going to have GPS support.  Sure, the iPhone may eventually support assisted GPS (where it uses the cell towers to determine the location) and that may work out well, but for now, it doesn&#8217;t look like any form of GPS will be supported in the near future.</li>
<li><strong>No tactile QWERTY keyboard </strong>I type at a decent speed on a regular keyboard and I know that speed will be drastically reduced on a mobile device, but I just can&#8217;t imagine how the virtual keyboard will work on the iPhone.  Apple says it takes a week or so to get the hang of it and then you&#8217;ll be typing at a productive speed, but I&#8217;m not so sure.  I type fast by not looking at the keys and can &#8220;feel&#8221; when I hit the wrong key and I don&#8217;t think that will translate well to the iPhone.  I have no doubt that the virtual keyboard will be really nice compared to using the standard phone keypad for text entry, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll be quite as good as a Treo/Blackberry type keyboard.  Maybe I&#8217;m under-estimating Apple here, but from the blogs I&#8217;ve seen where people tried to use the iPhone, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m too far off.  I&#8217;m sure this won&#8217;t be a huge issue for people that just want to send quick text messages, but if you&#8217;re like me and want the ability to respond to e-mails or post to a blog etc., then this may be an issue.</li>
<li><strong>Closed API and no SDK </strong>I realize most people don&#8217;t care about this at all, but as a software developer, I see this is quite a big issue.  Apple has said that third-party applications will be allowed on the phone as widgets (meaning HTML/JavaScript code that runs inside of Safari in the case of the iPhone).  It&#8217;s possible that Apple will expose key parts of the iPhone&#8217;s OS through javascript, but I haven&#8217;t heard anyone mention it yet.  To me, this means that you&#8217;ll have a powerful UNIX-based phone that really doesn&#8217;t do anything more than show pretty web widgets unless Apple decides to create more &#8220;real&#8221; applications for the phone.  Just seems like a waste of hardware too have so much potential trapped inside there with no way to access it - but maybe the widget interface will turn out better than anyone can imagine.</li>
</ol>

<time datetime="2007-06-24T23:14:12-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jun 24<span>th</span>, 2007</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I went to see the new Fantastic Four movie - I hadn&#8217;t planned on seeing it
since I wasn&#8217;t terribly thrilled with the first one.  I never read the comics,
but I do know some of the FF storyline somehow (a cartoon maybe?  can&#8217;t
remember&#8230;).  Anyway, a friend said he saw some reviews that said the movie
was pretty good - so I decided to tag along.</p>

<p>The first hour or so wasn&#8217;t all that great.  It was almost entertaining, but
not quite.  I think the little bit of the silver surfer story that I did know
ruined this part for me - they spend so long trying to figure out what is
going on that it just gets plain boring (not to mention the fact that it never
really goes into detail about what IS going on&#8230;).  I would say this part of
the movie was a little worse than Part 1.</p>

<p>The second half (more specifically, the last 20 or so minutes) was where the
good stuff can be found.  I actually liked end quite a bit - much better than
the first movie.  I won&#8217;t go into any details or anything, but it was
entertaining.  I don&#8217;t know that it made up for the entire $8.50 I spent to
see the movie, but it certainly helped.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a FF fan, then maybe you&#8217;ll love the movie.  If you&#8217;ve seen the
other movies out right now, then might as well see this one too.  If you&#8217;re
looking for the most entertainment bang for your buck, well, this probably
isn&#8217;t the film for you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw Shrek 3 this weekend - I wasn&#8217;t sure what it would be like&#8230;but lemme
tell you, it&#8217;s good.  It was really funny - most of the humor was for the
general audience, but there were the occasional parts that only the adults
will get.  All in all, the storyline was decent enough - it&#8217;s more along the
lines of the second movie instead of the first&#8230;basically expect more humor
with a so-so story line.  There weren&#8217;t really any big surprises, but it was
really entertaining.  I think my favorite part was when they meet the wizard
(a close tie with some of Puss&#8217; jokes).   If you liked Shrek 1 or 2, you owe
it to yourself to see Shrek the Third.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, I decided I don&#8217;t like using this particular URL for my personal
finance blog (called &#8220;The Business of Life&#8221;).  So, I&#8217;ve updated the site (both
the theme and Wordpress), removed the old posts, and I&#8217;m ready to start again.
If you&#8217;re looking for the old posts, well, for the time being, they don&#8217;t
exist anymore.  But, they will return to the internet in some form in a bit,
but at a different URL (and I&#8217;m not going to mention the URL because I decided
the finance blog should be more anonymous to be useful).  So sorry for any
confusion with people looking for old posts, but the stats didn&#8217;t show all
that many people looking at most of the pages anyway.</p>

<p>As far as this new blog goes, you can expect to see just about anything here -
well, except work stuff.  Since I work for a public company and such, I won&#8217;t
be talking about work on here.  Everything else is fair game - we&#8217;ll just see
where things go from here.</p>
