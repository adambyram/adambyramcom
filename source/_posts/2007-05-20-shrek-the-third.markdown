I saw Shrek 3 this weekend - I wasn't sure what it would be like...but lemme
tell you, it's good.  It was really funny - most of the humor was for the
general audience, but there were the occasional parts that only the adults
will get.  All in all, the storyline was decent enough - it's more along the
lines of the second movie instead of the first...basically expect more humor
with a so-so story line.  There weren't really any big surprises, but it was
really entertaining.  I think my favorite part was when they meet the wizard
(a close tie with some of Puss' jokes).   If you liked Shrek 1 or 2, you owe
it to yourself to see Shrek the Third.
