Recently, I decided I don't like using this particular URL for my personal
finance blog (called "The Business of Life").  So, I've updated the site (both
the theme and Wordpress), removed the old posts, and I'm ready to start again.
If you're looking for the old posts, well, for the time being, they don't
exist anymore.  But, they will return to the internet in some form in a bit,
but at a different URL (and I'm not going to mention the URL because I decided
the finance blog should be more anonymous to be useful).  So sorry for any
confusion with people looking for old posts, but the stats didn't show all
that many people looking at most of the pages anyway.

As far as this new blog goes, you can expect to see just about anything here -
well, except work stuff.  Since I work for a public company and such, I won't
be talking about work on here.  Everything else is fair game - we'll just see
where things go from here.
