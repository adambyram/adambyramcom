I've been a loyal reader of Business 2.0 for quite a few years now.  It is one
of the only magazines to which I subscribe.  I really look forward to getting
it each month to see all of the new business ideas and to read the magazine's
take on various things.  Well, I just received my October copy and this is the
end of the road for Business 2.0.  Apparently they never figured out how to
get/keep advertisers interested in the magazine and it the magazine's parent
company decided it didn't bring in enough cash to trouble with keeping the
magazine alive.  Some of the staff are going to write for Fortune, but I just
don't think it'll be the same.  All of the other magazines are stuffed with
ads, so I may buy a 100 page magazine, but only 40 of the pages are actual
content...and I'm not interested in flipping through ad after ad to find a
handful of stories that interest me - so I doubt I'll pick up a subscription
to anything else to replace Business 2.0.  Oh well, it was good while it
lasted.
