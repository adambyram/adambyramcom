I've been using the mac for just right around 5 months now. In that time, I've
found that there are a handful of applications I use very regularly, so I
thought I would share in case any other switchers are looking for apps to
check out. Here are my current top 5 (in no particular order):

  * [TextMate](http://macromates.com/)
  * [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/)
  * [1Password](http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password)
  * [Delicious Library 2](http://delicious-monster.com/)
  * [Quicksilver](http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/what_is_quicksilver)

### Other Noteworthy Apps

  * [Adium](http://www.adiumx.com/)
  * [VMWare Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/)
  * [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/)
  * [CyberDuck](http://cyberduck.ch/)
  * [Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/)
