I've had my 13" MacBook Air (mid-2011 model) for a few weeks now and thought it'd be a good idea to share my impressions.  I originally moved to Apple on a black MacBook, then switched to a top end 17" MacBook Pro, and now I'm on an Air.  

## What's Good?

**Weight**

It's fantastically light.  My MacBook Pro feels like a brick after using the MBA for a while.

**Size**

Not only is it light, it's thin.  Like, really thin.  It's not really that much thicker than my iPad and that's impressive when you consider it's a full featured computer.

**Battery Life**

I haven't used it for photo/video editing nor have I used it for games, so my usage is pretty moderate, but still, the battery life is excellent.  My MacBook Pro has a good battery life for its size, but the Air has been really impressive.  I haven't timed the battery life, but I can say that I frequently use it for extended periods of time without even thinking about the power cable.  That hasn't been my experience with other laptops (Apple or otherwise).  

**Solid State Drive**

It's amazing how much of a difference a solid state drive makes.  Startup is extremely fast, launching apps is even faster, and even development in a virtual machine is faster.  

## What's Bad?

**Screen Size**

It's totally usable for most of my everyday tasks, but for things like development, it's a bit small.  The good news is that it powers an external monitor just fine.  If you're on the go and need to do certain kinds of tasks, it'll feel a bit cramped.  I can't imagine the MacBook Airs line won't merge with the MacBook Pro line to provide the larger screen sizes in the future.

## Other Thoughts

That's actually the only negative thing I've noticed.  I happen to have the 4GB RAM/256GB SSD model, so it's maxed out on the basic specs.  It'd be nice if the RAM went up to 8GB, but honestly, 4GB has been plenty (even with large-ish databases loaded) due to the SSD.  The storage space may end up being a problem for me down the road if I started storing my main photo library, but I'm undecided how I want to handle that.  Overall, the MacBook Air is the best laptop I've used for my everyday tasks.  I'm sure I'll find a few things where I miss the power of my PC workstation or my MacBook Pro, but so far, I've really impressed.
