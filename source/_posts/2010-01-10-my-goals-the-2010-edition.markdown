Over the last year, I've been making a list of things I want to accomplish (or
at least think about accomplishing) in 2010. Now that 2010 is finally here,
it's time to define my final list of goals. I ended up with 24 goals. It's
unreasonable to think that I could focus on all 24 goals (plus any new ones
that come up during the year), so I'm only going to focus on three main goals.
I'm not going to ignore my other goals by any means, but these three items are
the places I'm going to focus 95% of my energy this year:

## Get healthy

I've learned a lot about healthier eating and exercise over the last year, but
I've failed at putting it into practice for an extended period of time. I want
to be healthier for quite a few good reasons and it's time I step up and do
it. For this goal, my criteria are that I must be able to sustain the
lifestyle changes and my target weight is 175 (with a stretch goal of 150) by
the end of the year. (I know weight isn't the only thing that makes one
"healthy", but I'm going to use it as the measurable part of this goal
anyway.)

## Side income to livable levels

I already make money on the side of my day job, but it's not much...certainly
nowhere close to anything I can live off. For 2010, my goal is to find a
sustainable way to bring in $2500/mo after taxes. This goal isn't to make that
much on the side *each* month this year, it's to *start* doing it so I could
support myself fully in 2011...a proof of concept essentially. If I can hit
this amount, that works out to around $30K/yr which is all I need to live very
comfortably at this point in my life.

## See a Space Shuttle launch (in person)

I went to space camp and I love NASA (and space exploration in general), but I
have yet to see a shuttle launch. It's something I've always wanted to do, but
I've never made the time. There are only 5 shuttle launches left (as of right
now) and they all happen in 2010. I don't care which launch I see, but I'm
going to see one in person (hopefully from the VIP area so I can get a good
view).
