So, it's been nearly 2 months since I last blogged...  I've had quite a few
things going on in those two months, probably as much or more than when I
first moved to TN.  I started remodeling my kitchen - the counter-tops will be
delivered on Friday if all goes as planned, then I'll get the sink in and
things will be all good.  I also changed jobs - I went from a relatively huge
public company with 55K-ish employees to a little bitty private software
company.  It's been quite a change, but it's great - it's exactly the type of
job I was looking for and I'm enjoying the people there (although I do still
miss the people at the previous employer).  Overall though, it was the right
move and I have no regrets.  Anyway - I plan to start blogging a few times a
week at least from now on, but we'll see what happens.
