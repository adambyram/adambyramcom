Today is my last day of work on the East Coast. It's a sad day since I'm
leaving a stable company full of good people and interesting opportunities. At
the same time, it's an exciting day since I'm leaving so I can prepare myself
for the 2200 mile move to Los Angeles before I start my dream job of building
spaceships. I never thought I'd be trading my reasonably large house in
Tennessee and basically all of my stuff for a tiny one bedroom apartment in
LA, but I never thought I'd be able to work on spaceships either.

I got a great send off from my coworkers. A few of them decided to do a little
decorating to my cube...

...and my car...

...but the best part was the cupcake. :)
