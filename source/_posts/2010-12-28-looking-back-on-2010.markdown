Back in January, I posted my [top three goals for
2010.](http://www.adambyram.com/2010/01/10/my-goals-the-2010-edition/

)

So how did I do? Well...

**Goal: Get Healthy**  
Result: Failed - I totally bombed this one. A lot of changes happened in 2010
that distracted me from this goal. This WILL be happening in 2011.

**Goal: Side Income to Livable Levels**  
Result: Success / Not Applicable - This originally came about because I wanted
to leave me previous job and work for myself. I did end up working for myself
anyway, but I didn't get my side income to livable levels. Having said that, I
did start a new job which negated this goal (and resulted in an even better
outcome in a lot of ways). I still love the idea of running my own business
and maybe it'll happen when it's time. I tried to force it this time and that
wasn't the right way to do it. In the meantime, everything is working out
pretty awesomely.

**Goal: See a Space Shuttle Launch (in person)**  
Result: Success - I hit a home run on this one. I watched the next to last
launch of Atlantis in May (from Titusville) and then I won the lottery by
being selected for the NASA Tweetup for Discovery's final flight. While I
didn't see Discovery launch (yet - 2011 goal now), I did get an amazing
experience at NASA including standing just a few hundred yards from Discovery
on the launchpad.

Overall, I'm OK with my progress (all things considered). I'm disappointed in
myself for not making progress on my "Get Healthy" goal, but it was a bit of a
crazy year. I'm happy with my direction heading into 2011 so 2010 was
definitely not a waste. While I may not have accomplished all of the goals I
wanted, 2011 is looking to be the best year yet.
