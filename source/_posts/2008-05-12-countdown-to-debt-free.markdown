At the end of last month, I paid off my student loans - it was quite hard to
write a $14,000 check, but once it was written, I didn't regret it at all. It
feels great knowing they are out of the way. The only debt I have left at this
point (other than my primary mortgage) is a second mortgage I got when I
bought my house (my down payment didn't go as far as I had hoped due to
closing costs, new house expenses, etc). This one is higher than my student
loans ($18,000), but it's possible that I can knock it out by the end of the
year assuming no major financial issues arise between now and then. I may end
up having to sell some stuff to make this happen, but we'll see how that
goes...I'm willing to do what is needed to take care of business.

This morning I sent in my monthly payment with a nice little $500 additional
principle attached and I'm already starting to feel better. :) Debt free, here
I come!
