I know I don't post very much to this blog...I never have really. I can't
quite figure out a good use for my domain. I post a reasonable amount on
[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/adambyram) these days, so I thought I'd give
[Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com) a try. It's a microblogging site - there is no
140 character limit like there is on Twitter, but it's setup in a way that
encourages quick, focused posts. I don't know if I'll stay active with it or
not, but since I don't have a good way to integrate my Tumblr posts into this
blog, I wanted to give you guys the direct link for any that are interested in
follow me there. Here's the URL:
