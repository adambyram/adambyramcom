A quick FYI on Amazon's Unbox service.  I had 7 rentals on my computer that I
had not been able to watch yet, but I needed to downgrade my Vista install to
32-bit (from the 64-bit version).  So I copied off the Amazon videos and
uninstalled the Unbox software.  Then after the new version of Vista was
installed, I tried to re-import the videos into Unbox (they provide an Import
function).  What I didn't realize is that the Unbox agreement says you can't
move rental videos from your original download location...  I'm not sure if
Amazon Customer Service is going to help here or not, but I think they will
this one time.  Something to keep in mind if you're thinking about getting a
video rental.
