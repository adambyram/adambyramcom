I saw a link to a "nerd test" while reading over the old RSS feeds from some
fellow Knoxville bloggers ([Mike ](http://www.vinull.com/Blogs/Default.aspx)&
[Dylan](http://www.dylanwolf.com/)) and I had to take it.  Apparently, I'm a
Nerd God - but I'm not sure why...my answers weren't really that "out there"
for most of the questions...  Of course, the fact that I don't see anything
"wrong" with my answers is probably part of the issue...or maybe I'm just that
l33t.

My score on [The Nerd? Geek? or Dork?
Test](http://www.okcupid.com/tests/9935030990046738815/Nerd-Geek-or-
Dork-):Modern, Cool Nerd

(60 % Nerd, 52% Geek, 43% Dork)

For The Record:

A Nerd is someone who is passionate about learning/being smart/academia. A
Geek is someone who is passionate about some particular area or subject, often
an obscure or difficult one. A Dork is someone who has difficulty with common
social expectations/interactions.

You scored better than half in Nerd and Geek, earning you the title of:
Modern, Cool Nerd.

Nerds didn't use to be cool, but in the 90's that all changed. It used to be
that, if you were a computer expert, you had to wear plaid or a pocket
protector or suspenders or something that announced to the world that you
couldn't quite fit in. Not anymore. Now, the intelligent and geeky have eked
out for themselves a modicum of respect at the very least, and "geek is chic."
The Modern, Cool Nerd is intelligent, knowledgable and always the person to
call in a crisis (needing computer advice/an arcane bit of trivia knowledge).
They are the one you want as your lifeline in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire
(or the one up there, winning the million bucks)!
