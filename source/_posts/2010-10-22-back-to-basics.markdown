If you read my blog in the browser and not via RSS, you may notice the look
has changed a bit. Everything is streamlined and I have a more minimalist
style. The blog is back to nice looking, easy to read text with minimal
distractions. I've decided a lot of things in my life are too cluttered these
days, so I'm starting my decluttering right here on the web. In addition to
the style, I've also simplified the categories on the blog to focus on the
things I really care about - life, money (personal finance), photography, and
tech. I'll expand those if the need arises, but having the categories this way
seems to give me a little more mental clarity. The RSS feed is also going
through FeedBurner now - your feed should have automatically swapped over, so
hopefully that won't cause any issues.

I'm also going to start blogging more. I know I've said that before, but I
mean it this time. I need to work on my writing and now I have more incentive
than normal since I do a good bit of tech writing at work. I can't promise the
topics will always be interesting, but I have a lot of things I want to talk
about. I have quite a few folders of ideas to post, but I have been holding
them because I originally thought I'd have a different site for each topic,
but I've decided against that. It's easier to keep all of the content in one
place and I'm more likely to write this way, so we'll see how it goes. More to
come in the near future...stay tuned.
