When the iPhone first launched, I [posted about three reasons I would NOT be
buying an iPhone](http://www.adambyram.com/2007/06/24/3-reasons-i-probably-
wont-buy-an-iphone/)...yesterday, I broke down and bought a 4GB iPhone.  So
what changed?

1) Price

I have a 5th generation iPod - so I don't need an 8/16GB+ player - so 4GB is
just fine with me.  Apple decided to discontinue the 4GB model, so the price
dropped to $299 from $499.  If you look at other smartphones out there, $300
isn't a bad price at all.

2) Seeing is Believing (i.e. why the on-screen keyboard works)

One of my original concerns was the fact that the keyboard has no feedback at
all.  After playing with the phone for a bit, it's pretty obvious the keyboard
is just fine.  There is a large keyboard for use with Safari for web browsing
and that keyboard is great.  Then there is a small keyboard for SMS, e-mail,
etc.  The small keyboard is usable, but it isn't quite as good.  But when I
thought about it, even the small keyboard is vastly superior to the other non-
querty keyboards and it's really not much worse than the hardware qwerty
keyboards I've used on a Treo.

3) Did I really need GPS? No.

I originally thought I really needed GPS in the phone - and I admit, I think
it would still be a great feature with the built-in Google Maps.  But after
thinking about this for a while, I came to the conclusion that I would most
likely use the maps to figure out what streets to take, finding where to
connect to the interstate, etc and really didn't need my position or real-time
navigation.  I also have a Garmin GPS unit for times when I really do want a
true GPS and I have a feeling it would work much better than anything they can
cram into a cellphone anyway.

The one thing I'm still worried about from my original post is 3rd party
application support.  The included applications are decent overall and I can
certainly get the job done, but it would be nice to have the option to extend
the functionality easily (e.g. adding a Pocket Quicken application).  I know
it's possible to do a hack on the phone to make this work (or was possible at
one point), but this is still something Apple needs to address.
