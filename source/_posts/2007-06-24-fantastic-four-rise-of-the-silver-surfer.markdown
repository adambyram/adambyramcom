So I went to see the new Fantastic Four movie - I hadn't planned on seeing it
since I wasn't terribly thrilled with the first one.  I never read the comics,
but I do know some of the FF storyline somehow (a cartoon maybe?  can't
remember...).  Anyway, a friend said he saw some reviews that said the movie
was pretty good - so I decided to tag along.

The first hour or so wasn't all that great.  It was almost entertaining, but
not quite.  I think the little bit of the silver surfer story that I did know
ruined this part for me - they spend so long trying to figure out what is
going on that it just gets plain boring (not to mention the fact that it never
really goes into detail about what IS going on...).  I would say this part of
the movie was a little worse than Part 1.

The second half (more specifically, the last 20 or so minutes) was where the
good stuff can be found.  I actually liked end quite a bit - much better than
the first movie.  I won't go into any details or anything, but it was
entertaining.  I don't know that it made up for the entire $8.50 I spent to
see the movie, but it certainly helped.

If you're a FF fan, then maybe you'll love the movie.  If you've seen the
other movies out right now, then might as well see this one too.  If you're
looking for the most entertainment bang for your buck, well, this probably
isn't the film for you.
