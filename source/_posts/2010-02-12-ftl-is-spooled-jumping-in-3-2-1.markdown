JUMP!

Today I resigned from my job at the small software startup.Â  I'm not going to
go into the details as to why I left, but I'll just say that I don't regret
joining the company, but I feel I may have regretted it if I stayed any longer
due to various things (including some opportunities outside of the company).

I'll be posting more about my future plans over at my company blog -
http://www.cogitu.com/blog/ - so if you're interested, be sure to check that
out for more details (a post will be up by Monday at the latest).
