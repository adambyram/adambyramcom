2011 was a crazy year for me.  It was a year full of change.  This year I:

- Started dating my beautiful girlfriend

- Watched the last launch of Space Shuttle Discovery from the NASA press site thanks to the STS-133 NASATweetup

- Took a great vacation to Charleston, SC

- I turned 30

- Moved 2200 miles from the East Coast to the West Coast for a new job

- Begin working a dream job in the space industry

There were some low points in 2011, but overall, it's been a good year.  In a lot of ways, I feel like 2011 was a transitional year.  All of the change is mostly finished at this point, so it feels like it's time for the good stuff to begin.  I'm *really* excited about 2012 - I think like it's going to be an amazing year.
