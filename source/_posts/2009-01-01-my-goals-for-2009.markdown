Now seems as good a time as any to post my a list of goals I want to
accomplish in 2009. I think everything is quite realistic. So, I now have 364
days left to:

#### Financial

  * Fully fund 2008 & 2009 Roth IRAs
  * Pay off second mortgage OR refinance into single mortgage (with much lower rate and no PMI)
  * Get my side income up to the point I could live off of it if the need arose (NOT trying to get this to replace my actual income level...although that would be fantastic if it did)
  * Maintain at least a 3 month emergency fund (currently at 12 months, but expect some of this to use used for other financial goals)

#### Health

  * Get weight to 190 or lower and keep it there (~25 lbs to lose)
  * Decrease caffeine intake - and keep it down (target is around 1 12oz can of soda per day or less)
  * Drink more water (no particular amount - just when I'm thirsty, grab a water instead of a soda)
  * Cook (healthly-ish) meals at home more than I eat out (including lunch)

#### Personal & Professional Development / Other

  * Read at least 1 non-fiction (but not computer related) book a month
  * Read at least 1 fiction book a month
  * Attend WWDC 2009 (contingent on other financial goals being met/on track in May)
  * Get my passport
  * Write at least one blog post per week on this blog - just to start writing more
