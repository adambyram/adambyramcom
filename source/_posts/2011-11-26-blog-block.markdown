I really thought I'd have a lot to blog about since this whole week was a
pretty crazy cross country adventure...but I can't seem to focus on blogging
at the moment.  I don't know if it's just a writer's block thing or what.
Whenever I sit down to write, I keep thinking I'm writing out some formal
document and that ends up causing me to keep thinking about it and then I just
stop.  My goal is to blog *more* now that I'm out in LA and I have lots of
friends around the country that will probably be interested in updates.  At
this point, I'm not sure what I'm going to do.  I thought about just using
Tumblr instead of my own custom WordPress install or I may simply start fresh
with this domain.  I'll definitely find a way to send out updates on my LA
adventure, but it looks like it'll be a little bit longer.

One quick update though - I did make it to LA just fine and both kitties made
it smoothly.  My furniture isn't here yet, so my apartment is basically empty
at the moment, but at least I'm here.  I'll post more in the near future, but
so far, so good.
