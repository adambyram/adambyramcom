I ran across an article the other day that I thought would be worth sharing -
it's called ["88 Important Truths I’ve Learned About
Life"](http://www.raptitude.com/2009/07/88-important-truths-ive-learned-about-
life/). I don't necessarily think 100% of these items are "truths" in my life,
but I'd say I can certainly agree with the vast majority of them. You should
read the whole article - but here were my top favorites (with my thoughts in
italics):

> 1. You can’t change other people, and it’s rude to try.

  
_I learned this one pretty early on - it has proven very true in my
experience. The key is that *you* can't change other people, but they *can*
change...they just have to do the changing themselves._

> 11. Every problem you have is your responsibility, regardless of who caused
it.

  
_I like this one a lot because too many people have a victim mentality. In the
end though, your problems are just that...*your* problems. You don't have to
solve them if you don't want to, but don't forget that they are yours to solve
and yours alone._

> 26. Credit card debt devours souls.

  
_Ok - this one is a little over the top for me, but I agree in general. Credit
card debt (or any kind of debt for that matter) will almost always detract
from you achieving your goals. If you manage it correctly, it may only have a
negligible impact on your life, but if you don't, it can easily destroy it. So
while I wouldn't go so far as credit card debt "devours souls", I do believe
that having it will, at some point, have a net negative impact on your life._

> 28. Most of what we see is only what we think about what we see.

  
_Out of all 88 items in the article, this is my favorite. Essentially,
everything you see is based around perception which means you'll color
everything you see with your own beliefs, assumptions, and knowledge.
Sometimes things will actually be what you perceived, but most than likely,
you only have a portion of the total picture._

> 48. Even if it costs no money, nothing is free if it takes time.

  
_I don't have anything special to add to this one - but I totally
agree...*nothing* is truly free._
