I finally finished the main story in Mass Effect just a couple of days ago. I
think I have about 15 hours of game time in...which is pretty short, but I
didn't do all that many of the side missions. The story was really excellent.
There were quite a few surprises along the way that really made things move
along nicely.

I think Final Fantasy 7 is still the best RPG I've played, but I would say
Mass Effect is in my overall top 10 games list. The only thing that never
really clicked for me was all of the equipment. Sure, you can buy fancy
weapons and and all kinds of upgrades, but I barely did any of that and the
game wasn't that hard to beat. I suppose I could up the difficulty level and
maybe all of the equipment would matter more.

In any event, it's a fun game if you like more action oriented RPGs. Depending
on your choices, it may feel a little too much like a FPS for some people, but
the balance seemed just about right to me. Now I can start watching for Mass
Effect 2 information...I've been trying to avoid it until I finished this just
to make sure I didn't see any of the ending before it was time.
