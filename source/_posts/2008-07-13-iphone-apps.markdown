Well, about three months ago, I applied for the Apple iPhone Developer Program
so I could build a few apps for my iPhone.  Last Friday, I was finally
approved.  I'm not sure why it took so long for Apple to open things up, but
I'm glad they finally released the finished SDK and let everyone in.  I'm sure
in the next couple of months, there will be some awesome applications out
there.  I've been working most of the weekend on my first app, but I'll talk
more about that later.

I did notice that one of the top 10 apps (#9 currently) is "iBeer" - it uses
the iPhone's accelerometer to display "beer" on the iPhone's screen that looks
as if it were in a glass when you tip the iPhone up to your mouth.  I think
it's an interesting use of the hardware and all, but I can't believe it's a
top 10 **non-free** app.  I mean, this thing costs $3 + tax...  Just amazing
what people value these days (but congratz to the developer for coming up with
that - paying off big time I'm sure).
