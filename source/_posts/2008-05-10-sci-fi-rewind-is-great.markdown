I love [Sci Fi Rewind](http://www.scifi.com/rewind/) - I haven't had cable TV
for two years now and the one show I wanted to watch, but couldn't find
legally online was Battlestar Galactica.  Now Sci Fi finally has it online for
free on Rewind.  BSG may have been on there earlier, but I never found it
until this season.  The thing I really like about Rewind is the fact that the
commercialsare short and the video automatically resumes once the commercials
are over.  I like ABC.com's quality (particularly the HD feeds - really nice
video), but I really dislike having to click the done button once the ad is
over...I'm just fine with the ads, but please, show them and then get out of
the way.  I'm glad to see Sci Fi understands this.
