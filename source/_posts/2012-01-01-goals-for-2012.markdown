It's that time of year again.  These goals will change over the course of the year, but today, my goals for 2012 are to:

- Pay off cat medical debt
- Sell (or rent) house
- Launch at least one new iOS game or app
- Get involved with open source

Of course, the standard goals of lose weight, eat better, save more, and the like are all things I plan to work on as well.  The goals above are specific to 2012.  It should be a fun & exciting year.
