I don't normally blog about random things I see on the internet, but I ran
across an article by John C. Dvorak today ([The iPhone Is No
Desktop](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2278816,00.asp)) that really
annoyed me enough that I have to do this. John is basically saying that it's
ridiculous that people are using the iPhone as a desktop computing platform
and that drives him crazy in many ways (10 ways to be exact). I don't disagree
that the iPhone is not a "desktop replacement" in the typical sense, but what
bothers me is the fact that he thinks this is important.

In the technical world, so many people still believe the "platform" is the key
to everything. There are always discussions about which platform is the best -
laptop vs desktop vs PDA, Windows vs OS X vs Linux, Nikon vs Canon, Ford vs
Chevy - you get the point. That's all fine and dandy and I don't disagree that
sometimes there are certain benefits to using a specific platform. But the
kicker is that this is a stupid argument to begin with.

People don't care about the platform. Even if you think you care, you probably
don't when you get right down to it. For example, when I'm using the Windows
platform, I keep my current TODO list in Microsoft Outlook. Now that I also
work on a Mac, I decided to move my TODO list to an
[online](http://www.rememberthemilk.com) platform. Sure - I moved to a
different "platform" because it made it easier to get to my TODO list from
either OS, but it's not the platform I really care about, it's the data.

Whether my TODO list is on the web, on my desktop, on my iPhone, or on my
physical notepad, the platform is of little importance to me as long as my
list is there and it's accessible when I need it. The platform only comes into
the picture when it can better enable me to manipulate my data in ways that
make me more efficient and effective. In reality, forget the platform and
focus on the data (or on the actions driven by the data) and you'll see that
the platform being the key is a fallacy in this day and age.
