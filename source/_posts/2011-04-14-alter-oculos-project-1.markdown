A few guys I know decided to start a photo group on Flickr called Alter
Oculos. It's a group for sharing photowalk images and trying out some photo
projects as a group. This week, we decided to all use the same set of shots,
but then we'll all process them and compare our take on the post processing.
These are my two finished images. I think the first turned out ok, but I
really like the second image quite a lot.
