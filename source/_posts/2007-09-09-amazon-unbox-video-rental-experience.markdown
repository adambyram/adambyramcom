I noticed Amazon had a $0.99 sale on a couple of new movies I had been wanting
to see (Ghost Rider, 300, Shooter) so I decided to give it a try - after all,
no shipping, no tax, means you can't beat the price.  My setup is Windows
Vista Ultimate 64-bit and an Xbox 360 with wireless adapter (I stream the
movies to the HDTV via the 360).  My initial impressions:

**The Good**  
Install and movie purchase was quick and simple overall (however, it is a tiny
bit less simple for 64-bit users...more on that later).  It was dead simple to
stream to the 360 - if you already have the media center connection setup,
then you're ready to go.  The quality is on par with DVD - it's certainly not
HD, but I was watching on a 56" HDTV and it looked as good as any DVD I have.

**The Bad**  
When I first installed the software, I got a message saying something was
wrong with my computer's DRM configuration.  My only guess is that it has
something to do with being on a 64-bit - but I really don't know.  The Unbox
software offers to help troubleshoot - so I did that and it found a patch to
automatically install...after that, everything went fine.  The download speed
is a bit slow - I rented 5 movies the first night (you can keep them for 30
days) at around 10pm.  By 8am or so the next morning, 4 of the 5 movies were
downloaded.  The files are between 1.5GB - 3GB - so it's certainly going to
take a while to download them, but the speed could be just a tad better...but
it's not a huge issue - just realize that you'll need to wait about an hour or
so after you rent the movie before you can start playing it.  The biggest
issue I have with Amazon's Unbox service is the lack of 5.1 channel audio -
the audio quality is decent, but it's certainly not on the same level as a DVD
and there is no true surround sound.

**Conclusion**  
There's no question that Unbox is a great deal if you find a movie you'd like
to see for $0.99 - it's the way to go at that price.  I'm not sure I'll be
using it for full price rentals though ($3.99) - for that price, I can get
NetFlix or Blockbuster Online (and better sound quality).  If Amazon can drop
the price to $1.99 for a one day rental, I'd be doing a lot more Unboxing.
